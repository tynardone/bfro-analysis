Many times he would interpret for me and the group when participating in scout events.  Only three deaf person, including myself saw exactly the same creature at the same time and the other three did not see it.  We used sign language to talk to eachother so some of us were paying attention to eachother when communicating in sign language.  That is probably why half of us saw this creature and the other half did not.  Between the three of us that saw the bigfoot were visibly shakened up while the other three thought we were joking around.  After the other three realized how badly shakened up we were they started to believe us.  It was not possible for the three of us to come up with the same frightening experience at the same time without any previous planning and scheme.  It was for real."

Our group hiked to the cave and briefly explored the mouth of the cave. The children wanted to go into the cave, but the dad's not being in the mood to crawl around in the dirt at night, decided no one would go far into the cave. We sat in the cave mouth talking for about ten minutes and then decided to hike back. About a tenth of a mile from the cave the moan was heard by the two fathers in the direction of behind us to the right. I initially heard the sound quite clearly but not wanting to alarm the children I said nothing. About two seconds after the noise my brother in law, a LT. in the US Army, asked me what the sound was. I replied ""I don't know"". We then heard a dog bark farther away and some short deep noises in the vicinity of the first moan. He then asked me if I thought the sound was made by an animail and I again replied ""I don't know"". About 10 steps later I suggested we put children on our shoulders and ""make some time"".

He quietly continued to bark.  Meanwhile the neighbors dogs were barking first to the west of our home and then at our home and then to the east of our home.  The neighbors homes are located approximately 1/4 mile from our house both east and west.  It was obvious that whatever the dogs were barking at, was moving from west to east in the dark behind all of our homes.  This area is farmland fields.  The dogs to the west quieted, then our dog started barking loudly again, then the dogs to the east began barking.  It even sounded as if they were growling and fighting with whatever it was.  It was a still night, and the sound was traveling.  When the neighbors dogs to the east quieted down, I thought I would be able to sleep.  However, a few minutes later I heard a loud rustling in the bushes outside my family's home.  My window was large and open on the second story of their home.  I looked out my window to see what it was.  That's when I saw it emerge from the thick trees and bushes, cracking branches as it stepped out of the shrubbery and into our front yard."

930,"We were split up into 2 groups and coming back to our initial camp from a day trip to Cape Alava where we were doing a biological exploration of the tide pools and area. I was in the lead group of about half the kids, with I think 2 of the teachers. The second group was aprox. 1/2 to 1 mile behind us. I can't reacall the distance of them well. Our group crossed a small stream that came out of the treeline about 50 to 75 meters from the waterline. I remember the stream being too big to jump across, but not very deep. Only to just below the tops of my Raichle hiking boots. After we had waded the stream and walked/ran about another 300 meters down the beach, we were told to wait by one of the teachers. I remember stopping, and turning around to wait for the rest of my group with a couple more kids. As we were waiting and watching.As memory serves, it was 5 or 6 teachers and about 20 or 30 teenagers."

1504,Myself
61157,"My wife was the only one who experienced the touch, but we both saw the fingerprints."
6806,I was alone.
28123,"A note from [witness'] mom:  While no one else in the family saw the animal that frightened him, I do well remember him running into the house, quite terrified and almost incoherent, saying he'd seen a ""big white thing"" on the other side of the bushes.  We had, at the time, a white standard poodle named Charlie, and when I asked him if perhaps he'd just seen her instead, he denied it vehemently, exclaiming, ""How could Charlie have got that big?!""  I went out to see if I could find any trace of anything, but the ground was baked hard and there were no tracks of any sort.  An acquaintance suggested a day or two later that I look for hair caught on a branch, which I did, but I found nothing.  Less than a week later, a cougar was spotted in our neighbor's field, so I thought perhaps this was what my son had seen, or perhaps a deer, with bright sunlight shining on its fur, making it seem white.  While we couldn't determine what he actually saw, the effect on him was unmistakable.  For days, he would not go out of the house.  If we had to drive somewhere, he insisted that both my husband and myself held his hands while we went from the front door directly to the car, and even then, he was obviously spooked and nervous.  Eventually he did go outside with his older siblings to play again, but it was many weeks before he'd venture out of the yard or go play alone.This all happened when he was 2 1/2 years old, so he didn't have the vocabulary to fully describe his encounter, but there was no doubt that something traumatic had indeed taken place.  For years, we referred to this mysterious incident rather jokingly as ""[Witness'] big white thing"" and didn't think too much about it.  Then, a few months ago, when an alleged bigfoot sighting on the east coast made the news, [witness] and I looked the subject up on your website and also looked at clips on you-tube.  I still had not made the connection, and I don't know if [witness] had, either.  But when we saw accounts of white sasquatches being spotted, I looked at [witness] and he looked at me, and I just let out an ""Oh, my goodness!""  I asked him to describe the incident for me again, what he remembered of it, now that he was older, to see if any light could be shed on it.  I had always thought he saw an animal move past him on the other side of the bush, but he clarified that for me, saying, ""No, Mom, it ROSE UP from the other side of the bush.""  This also struck a chord from what I later read on your website.  He also says that, to this day, it remains the most terrifying thing he has ever encountered.  He won't even watch bigfoot documentaries now because they bring back frightening memories.  I also asked him if, at the time this happened, he had even heard of ""bigfoot"" or ""sasquatch"" and had any idea what was meant by these terms.  He said he had, but his concept of bigfoot was a giant man, like Paul Bunyan.  The fact that he didn't have any preconceived ideas about encountering a sasquatch as a tall, furry, thick-set animal just adds credence to his story, in my opinion."
8375,My little brother thought he never actually saw it. He heard the commotion and knew something was going on.
933,"Mrs. Brenda G., a young mother, German, recently moved to Washington from the US South, doing dishes; her 15-and-a-half-year old son Nick, a short but muscular and macho kid, doing homework; her 5 year-old son, John, playing outside on the lawn; two dogs, one pony.

Our family and friends have camped at Kalaloch several times every summer for eighteen years and I was looking forward to spending the week with them. We had not come the year before because of building a new home. I was driving along with the music on loud and thinking about what condition I would find camp after Dad and the boys having set up without me! I was also thinking of how beautiful the surrounding mountains and forest were with the rain glistening. The creature took me by surprize and it may have been half way across the road before I realized what I was seeing."

1570,"Bear hunting on foot.CONFIDENTIALITY: This information is offered to assist those that research the Bigfoot phenomenon. Since it only involves a track discovery (versus an actual sighting), it may not be of much use to you. On the other hand, since it involved 3 different sized tracks possibly made by a small band (family group?), it may be of value in group-dynamics study of this creature. If there is a way to share this info with serious researchers only (versus enticing any net-surfer with a gun to invade the woods around Ione) I would prefer it. If you are going to post it in the general area, please include the request for low-profile activity. The reporting party is reluctant to discuss this with others due to the stigma attached, and does not run around showing the casting and pictures to strangers. He mainly took them as proof to himself that he found what he did. As I mentioned, the casting is pretty rough. Reporting party is a 50+ y/o resident of the Spokane area. I believe his recounting of the incident and the Ione-area history of sightings (as relayed to him by his contacts) to be unembellished and factual. I wish to remain confidential as a source. Though this info is second-party, I hope it is of some help."
