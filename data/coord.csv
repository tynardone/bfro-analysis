147,"At our home south of South Lake Tahoe, we have been hearing tell-tale screams for the last three months. I have several recordings of these screams, and have been in coordination with three of the curators involved with the BFRO for northern California. Suffice it to say that almost nightly, we have been witness to a resounding number of screams/wails which have not been attributable to coyote nor other ""known"" forms of animal call/sound.  The sounds have occurred from 9:00pm through 7:00am in the morning on a consistent basis.  I have made several recordings, mostly from my bedroom window. We have made several all-night forays into the forest in an attempt to capture the sounds. My brother and I have made extensive backpacking trips into the wilderness surrounding this area in an attempt to pin down the most likely locations for activity, and we feel we have narrowed it down very well (based upon our normal reception of sound and habitational demographic...) I have found tracks in this area which i have photographed as well as ""beds"" with torn branches/etc. which may very well be attributable to bear activity, although the screams at night are definitely not.  Areas in question are well off of the beaten path. Description:  A mournful wail. Sounds like a locator beacon (like a sonar ""ping"") usually answered by another of lower pitch, and both seem to converge at some point--after which both cease to sound.  We (my brother and I) have noticed coyote howls interspersed with the ""other"" sounds.  We have thoroughly explored the areas surrounding our location, some of which our dogs refused to enter.  We've camped out all night with bait, only to give up and head in to hear them after we've been tucked away for a good thirty minutes--leaving us dead tired with no ""substantial evidence"". "

1350,"REPORT OF A FIELD INVESTIGATION by Richard D. McCuistion, Sr., Chilton Williamson, and Keith Foster  Between 4 and 7 August 1998 we began a long term study in a drainage thought to be the summer range of the Sasquatch(s) described by Foster in the Big Foot Research Organization’s geographical data base for Conejos County, Colorado.  Our purpose was to spend at least six days in the study area to establish our presence deep into, what we thought might be, the home range of the creature and to familiarize ourselves with the area.  Exact locations within Townships 35 and 36 North and Range 4 East will not be divulged here because of the area’s importance to us as a long term study area.  Also, it is not recommended that anyone, other than serious researchers who coordinate their activities in the area with us, venture into this area because of its remoteness and the unusual occurrences that we experienced. The study area is heavily timbered with slopes ranging from about 10% (6§) to over 100% (45§) and elevations ranging from 9400 feet above mean sea level (MSL) to over 12,000 feet above MSL.  The off road terrain is extremely rough and suitable campsites are almost nonexistent.  The soils are granitic, very firm, and not particularly conducive to animals with soft feet leaving discernible tracks -- shod horses weighing 1,000 pounds or more generally left slight hoof impressions in the surface of the dirt road.  The study area is summer range for an apparently sizable population of elk (Cervus elaphus).  The cow elk and their calves that I observed were numerous, well fed, and healthy.  I believe that this population serves as a prey base for the alleged resident sasquatch(es) as well as other large predators including man.  No evidence of bears was seen on this trip, but that does not preclude them from existing there. The first twenty-one hours spent in the study area by Williamson and me were uneventful.  We found a suitable campsite that had a fire ring and other evidence of recent human usage -- possibly by seasonal elk hunters.  The campsite lay between dense forest and rising terrain on the north-northwest, east and southeast sides and a large wet meadow that drains into the _________ Creek on the west side. The meadow covers an area of about 230 acres and is oriented on a northwest-southeast axis.  It was about 250 yards wide west-southwest of our campsite. At 16:00 MDT, 5 August 1998, Williamson and I heard five distinct primate-like calls apparently originating from an 11,000 foot high ridge north of the campsite.  The vocalizations resembled those of a large man rising from a low pitch to a higher pitch before ending -- something like ""Uuuuhhhhaaaa - Uuuuhhhhaaaa"" and were similar to the vocalizations that I heard near Leadville during the early morning of 23 October 1994.  The vocalizations stopped before they could be recorded.  To our knowledge, no other humans were within four and a half miles of our campsite.  A possible hiker’s camp was observed by us as we drove into the area the previous day. It was approximately four and a half miles southeast of our camp and was next to the access road and a pack trail leading up to _______Peak.  This camp was located at about 9400 feet above MSL and the intervening, rough, and heavily wooded terrain rose to over 11,000 feet above MSL.  By road, the distance between camps was greater than seven miles.  At about 16:30 MDT, we were joined by Keith Foster and his son Andrew.  We discussed the vocalizations and it was noted that our campsite was about ______ miles from the site of Foster’s scream encounter of June 1994. At about 01:40 MDT, 6 August 1998, Williamson was awakened by an undetermined disturbance.  Since he had decided to keep his horses in their trailer that night, it may have been their movements in the trailer that awakened him.  At about 01:57 MDT, he heard a vocalization coming from nearby that sounded something like ""Ahhhh - uuuhhhh"" -- a diminutive, rhythmic, and almost conversational form of the vocalization heard the preceding afternoon.  Also, this vocalization was repeated several times and was followed by a pair of low, sharp clicks as if two hard objects or rocks were being struck together.  Foster also heard the clicks.  The vocalization seemed to emanate from a small ridge less than a quarter of a mile northeast of our campsite.  Unfortunately, Williamson was unable to awaken me sufficiently for me to corroborate his observations. After daybreak on 6 August, we observed several elk cows and their calves grazing on a bench about one half mile southwest and upslope of our campsite.  Several bulls were observed bedded down above the timberline on the east-northeast slopes of _______Peak.  After breakfast, we conducted a brief examination of the area north of our campsite, but nothing unusual was observed.  Foster and his son departed to examine the bait sites that he had established near the site of his scream encounter.  These bait sites were established in mid-July 1998 and were designed to collect hair samples and hand prints.  Williamson and I rode the horses further down the drainage following a closed logging road.  We rode about one and a half miles down-drainage before coming to the end of the closed road.  We found the road washed out and impassable by vehicle.  At the road’s end, we found a major game trail that continued down the_________Creek drainage, but we elected not to follow it because of the deadfall and snags which made going impossible for the horses.  While at this location, I took the opportunity to pound rhythmically on a hollow log with a large rock for about 30 minutes;  my effort, however, elicited no response.  We retraced our path to our campsite and rode beyond it to an old clear-cut.  The exact date of the cut is not known, but it shows up on the aerial photography taken on 29 August 1989 as a recently disturbed area.  This clearcut is now an open meadow with slopes of about 10% to 20% and is covered with a generous growth of grasses, sedges, and some pine saplings ten or twelve feet in height. Numerous cow and calf elk tracks, along with recently used beds, were observed throughout this area. At 18:03 MDT, 6 August 1998, numerous and sustained primate-like screams or roars were heard by Williamson and me reverberating around our campsite. The direction from which the vocalizations emanated could not be determined, and the quality of the calls seemed to have a definite edge or harshness over the vocalizations heard the previous day.  They sounded something like ""Rrrrraaaahhhh - Rrrrraaaahhhh!"".  These vocalizations lasted for about four minutes and, again, I was unable to record them.  The horses were securely tethered to the rear of their trailer and we turned in for the night at about 22:30 MDT which coincided with the rising of a full moon. At about 02:00 MDT, 7 August 1998, Williamson and I were awakened by Foster’s vehicle alarm system, which caused a few moments of pandemonium, and Foster shouting, ""False alarm!"".  He then advised us of the events preceding the alarm’s activation.  He stated that he had been awake when he began to hear a rhythmic rock-clacking 50 to 100 yards north of the campsite.  The sounds of two rocks being struck together began at about 01:40 MDT.  He described the sound as having a definite cadence of one strike per second and lasting for a period about twenty seconds.  He observed that the horses were fully alert , extremely nervous or frightened, stamping and snorting and both of them were trying to position the horse trailer between themselves and the source of the rock-clacking.  There were no slopes around the campsite steep enough for a dislodged rock to tumble down and duplicate the steady cadence that he heard.  Upon hearing the clacking and observing the fright exhibited by the horses, he attempted to lower the window of his sport utility vehicle in order to hear better, but inadvertently activated the alarm system which caused Williamson and me to respond to the emergency with weapons at the ready. The events leading up to the alarm were discussed, especially the horses’ exhibited behavior.  They are experienced mounts for deer and elk hunting and have been used on numerous such hunts to pack out downed game.  They have also been exposed to bear which, according to their owner, frighten them considerably.  Foster expressed the opinion that no further incidents would be forthcoming because of the noise made by the alarm and our activity and then he retired for the night.  Williamson and I decided to maintain a listening watch.  Within 45 minutes after activity in the camp subsided, the horses began to alert again and, with the aid of a sound amplifying device, Bionic Ear, stealthy, creeping footfalls could be heard.  Although the device had a directional parabola, there was enough spurious background noise from over-flying jet aircraft to make precise directional orientation difficult; still, the footfalls that I heard were definitely not the thudding noise made by the horses or other hoofed animals as they walk.  It became apparent that the horses were confirming what I was hearing and that they were giving us an accurate bearing on the intrusions.  The horses never alerted toward the meadow on our open west-southwest flank. To aid us in our surveillance, we also used a pair of night vision goggles, but despite a full moon and the unit’s infrared spotlight, viewing into the shadows wasn’t very productive because of the jumble created by branches and snags.  A four celled Mag-Lite was also used to pan suspected areas and at about 04:00 MDT red eye-shine was detected.  The eye-shine appeared as two parallel, reddish pinpoints which winked off and on at about the same visible plane as the base, and to the side of, a lone tree growing on the southwest rim of a small swale.  The swale began about 15 yards north of the horse trailer and was approximately 25 yards in diameter.  A person of average height standing in it would be unable to see over the rim and into our campsite.  The eye-shine’s color was consistent with the red or orange reported by Grover Krantz (""Big Foot-Prints"", 1992), while the color of the eye-shine cast by the horses was lime green.  Despite a full moon and clear meteorological conditions, no grazing elk or other nocturnal animals were observed at any time during the night.  (An absence of browsing deer and nocturnal animals was previously reported by me in my report of the alleged sasquatch screams and response calls that I heard near Leadville, CO in October 1994.)  The meteorological conditions then were basically the same as on the morning of 7 August 1998.  Moonset occurred at about 05:30 MDT. The intrusions occurred at intervals of one every 45 to 60 minutes and always began with the horses alerting in a different direction toward the forest around us.  Stealthy footfalls and movements would be detected and we would wait until we were absolutely sure that an animal was close by; then we would unzip the tent’s insect netting and pan the suspected area with the night vision goggles or the Mag-Lite. An interesting, and I believe important, observation is of the horse’s behavior preceding successive intrusions.  They were becoming more accepting of whatever was encroaching upon our campsite.  Bears are ruled out because they were not observed and the horses did not exhibit the fear reaction they are known to show in a their presence. After daybreak, the area around the campsite was examined for tracks and other disturbances.  The ground’s surface was, as stated previously, very firm and fairly even, with a layer of pine needle duff under the trees and grasses and sedges in the open areas.  Rock outcrops occurred throughout, and the open areas were moist from a heavy dew and a light rain shower from the previous afternoon.  An animal’s bed was found about 90 yards north of the campsite under a tree above the northern rim of the swale.  This position or bed provided an excellent, but screened, view of our campsite. The bed was dry and appeared fresh, and I did not observe any hoofprints or footprints in or around it although the soil and duff were disturbed.  There was no detectable odor in the bed.  Foster picked up two base-ball sized rocks and struck them together to demonstrate the sound he had heard earlier that morning.  The noise he produced startled the horses and elicited their undivided attention during the demonstration.  Conclusions: 1.  Primate-like vocalizations were heard on three separate occasions between 5 and 7 August 1998.  The vocalizations heard in the afternoons of 5 and 6 August 1998 could not have been made by a human without the aid of a megaphone because of the dense forest and vegetation which quickly attenuated sound.  These vocalizations lasted for a period of not more than five minutes each occurrence and were definitely produced by a living animal and not by a tape player.  The vocalizations heard on 5 August had, as interpreted by Williamson, a ""Heads up or general announcement"" quality to them, whereas those vocalizations heard on 6 August were more like ""Now hear this!"".  The vocalization heard during the early morning of 6 August had a conversational quality to it and was followed by a pair of low, sharp clicks which were also heard by Foster.  2. The footfalls and movements heard with the Bionic Ear were consistent with the night movement techniques that I learned during my training as a combat infantryman.  The technique was, basically, to place the toe of your boot carefully but firmly, avoiding branches, twigs, or dry leaves, and then gradually shift your weight to that foot so as to minimize the sound of vegetation being crushed or soil being shifted.  It is apparent to me now that the tent’s zipper broadcast our alertness and the panning spotlight confirmed it.  3.  The horses that we had with us were, initially, invaluable as an early warning system, but they seemed to become accepting of whatever it was that kept encroaching upon our campsite.  It appeared to their owner that they were beginning to show the same interest in the intruder(s) as they did when one of us approached them.  4.  We were not subjected to the same sort of intimidation or threat displays, such as screams, and thrashing of vegetation that others have reported in their sasquatch encounters.  This difference in behavior could have been due to our numbers and the nature of our presence in the area.  We all carried firearms, we actively scouted the area, we made drumming noises on a hollow log, we didn’t hunt the elk that abounded the area, and we remained vigilant during the night.  5.  Williamson and I had the distinct impression that we were dealing with an adversary rather than a curious and semi-intelligent animal. My conclusion is based on my personal instincts and experience as a former Marine who has seen some combat and Williamson’s was based on his ""gut feeling"" as he had no previous experience with anything like this.  We independently noted the change in the quality of the afternoon vocalizations between 5 August and 6 August, the use of non-verbal communication in the form of rock-clacking, and the repeated probing of our campsite on the morning of 7 August 1998.  The rock-clacking could be interpreted as a form of close range communication intended to mimic naturally occurring sounds which would not tend to alert a quarry.  According to Foster, such communication is sometimes used by bow hunters when hunting Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) and Mountain Goats (Oreamnos americanus) because they tend to disregard the sound of falling rock 6.  The probing of a position is a complex, aggressive, and hostile act that is used to determine the strengths and weaknesses of an adversary. It is my opinion that the use of this device could only be made by an intelligent, sentient being or beings of potentially dangerous capability or intent.  Although there are no recently documented incidents of anyone being attacked by a sasquatch(es), the above described occurrences, the Ape Canyon incident described by John Green (""On The Track of the Sasquatch"", 1980), and the reference to chimpanzee hunting behavior described by Jane Goodall (""The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior"", 1986) caused my personal warning flags to go up.  Keith Foster’s ""gut feeling"" was that the encroachments on our campsite amounted to nothing more than simple curiosity. 7.  After considering all of the events leading up to the night of 6-7 August, Williamson and I decided to cut short our planned stay and to leave when Foster and his son left for their home in Kansas.  It was clear to us that our campsite could not be defended because of the surrounding terrain and forest and we did not want to test the intruder’s intelligence and tactical ability with just two people and a pair of increasingly relaxed  horses.  If we had, indeed, been probed the night before, we were obviously under constant surveillance and it would have been readily apparent to an intelligent being(s) that it had the advantage. 8. Although no conclusive evidence was found that would support a claim that our campsite had been visited or probed by a sasquatch(es), the area warrants further, and careful,  investigation which we intend to,  systematically, accomplish.

3024,"Since my wife and kids were away visiting my parents in Ohio, two co-workers (A.S. and D.G.) and myself decided to try our hand at bigfoot ""hunting"" after hearing about the BFRO expedition to Skookum on the Medved radio show and then reading about it on the website.  We decided to camp out two nights (starting Friday) at the Tillicum campsite which was about 4 miles from Skookum, hike into Skookum Saturday, and then leave Sunday morning.All three of us were sharing a four man tent and after going to bed Friday night, I was awoken by A.S. who mentioned that there were strange sounds outside. At that point all three of us were lying there awake. The first sound that I heard sounded just like coyotes but then I heard a weird gutteral growl like sound (which in all truth kind of gave me the shivers). That was the last sound I heard and before going back to sleep I remember commenting aloud ""weird"".The next morning before going out on the hike we talked briefly about the sounds and A.S. mentioned that before the coyote sounds there were some stranger sounds that had woke him up (more about this and the other sounds later).On the hike down trail 21 we found some deer trails that per A.S.'s GPS system looked like they went down do Skookum. We decided to follow the trail and maybe an eighth of a mile down the trail A.S. got excited and pointed to what could have been prints.  The prints were vague but did appear to be somewhat human shaped with possible toe and hill prints (the ground was fairly firm and the prints did not look fresh). I would say that the prints looked like size 12 or 13 feet. The prints also appeared to go down the trail and there were possibly 4 or 6 that we could make out. Since the prints were pretty vague it would have been impossible to make casts and we decided that the pictures probably wouldn't come out well (now I wish that we had).For the rest of the trip we didn't see or hear anything strange. After the trip we discussed the prints more and of the three of us, D.G. appeared convinced that the prints were the real thing, I was fairly neutral giving them about a 50% chance of being the real thing (I would like to have higher confidence but I was worried that we could be biased in that we ""really"" wanted to see something) and A.S. who had been the first to see them and initially very excited pretty much talked himself out of thinking they were anything of importance BUT he kept mentioning those weird sounds we heard the first night and how he thought they might have been something.I didn't think too much about the sounds besides doing my rendition of them for my wife, brother, and sons until the night of Friday August 17th. Up until that time the main reason why I didn't pay them as much attention as I later would is that they didn't sound like the sounds available on the BFRO website. That all changed on the 17th though when I was getting ready to put a movie in the VCR and noticed that ""Encounters with the Unexplained"" on the PAX channel had a special on Sasquatch.  After watching for about three minutes, they played supposed bigfoot sounds and several of them WERE JUST LIKE THE ONES I/WE HEARD!! My wife who was in the next room unpacking heard the same sounds on the tv and noticing how similar they were to my renditions made a comment as to whether or not those were the same I heard. In that instant when I heard those sounds on TV I decided that we had heard a bigfoot and for about the next half an hour I had goosebumps going up and down my body (my wife was shocked/amused about how shaken up/freaked out I was).On Sunday I called A.S. up (he had been away for the weekend) and questioned him more about the sounds that had originally woken him up. He said that he had first heard a long moaning like sound followed by a loud wail which was followed by the coyote and other sounds which I had also heard.  We decided that we might as well submit this report to BFRO and after talking with D.G. he also agreed.My apologies that this is such a long story just about some bigfoot sounds and possible prints but I am still very excited about it all and thought that you might be interested due to this all happening in the area close to Skookum.

4077,"Hi,    I am relaying this story for my brother since I have access to the net and he does not, but I will relate the story to you just as he told it to me with his permission. My name is [PB], I am 35 years old and live in Salem, VA in Roanoke County. My brother [RB] who actually had the sighting on April 4 of this year is 8 years younger.  I have several rental properties in this area and my brother is my repair person/handy man.  One particular rental property is vacant and it happens to be directly in front of the house that I live in now.  On Thursday April 4, 2002, my brother was painting the interior of this house.  I work 2nd shift and usually get home around 11:30 each night.  At 11:30 I noticed that my brother was still working on the house so I stopped to see how things were going.  He was visibly shaken so I asked him if anything was wrong.  He then told me that at aprox. 10:45pm that night, he took a break and went out to the front yard to smoke a cigarette.  He heard a dog barking back in the woods, about a 100 yards away.  A short time later my dog became extremely agitated, barking and growling.  He was startled because he had never known my dog to behave in this manner.  He then heard something large ""crashing"" through the trees, and what he saw, he just couldn't beleive.  He said he saw a ""very large creature"" traveling at a high rate of speed and making a very loud ""gutteral grunting noise"" running much faster than a human could possibly run.  He said he got a very good look at it before it crossed the road and went out of sight. It's arms were swinging down by it's sides.  He said it was very broad and very tall but he could not tell me just how tall it was.  He said that it was very hairy, and described the hair as ""long and curly like a sheepdog"".  He said that it appeared to be a silver-gray color.  (All the reports of bigfoot sightings I have ever read however seem to say that they are brown or black in color).     My brother said that he would be glad to speak to anyone who might be interested in hearing his story first hand.  This is also not the first sighting in this area that I have heard about.  I also have a good friend who tells me that he saw a ""Bigfoot"" while out scouting for deer in Ironto VA. in Montgomery county.  Acording to my GPS, it is 9 miles from here as the crow flies.  I can honestly say that I absolutely beleive my brother's story and my friend's as well.  Thank you very much for the great work and I look forward to hearing from you,Sincerely,[PB] "
5176,"My original plans were for a trip to northern California to visit the famous Bluff Creek film site and drop off some casts and pictures to the Willow Creek Museum, arriving on this day, the 35th anniversary of it’s making, October 20th. I had talked with Joe Beelart about this trip, because he had just returned from the area with a party of 10, including Peter Byrne, Todd Neiss, film crew and our own Al Berry and Ron Morehead. Joe talked me out of going there by myself because of the terrain and for safety reasons, so I altered my plans. I decided to divide this trip up into three parts… doing some things and going some places I had been meaning to for a long time. Skookum Meadows revisit, Estacada and the Wynooche river drainage.  I usually make trips like this in search of areas to investigate for longer periods of time at later dates. I do these scouting trips mostly alone and try to cram as much as possible into them.  Oct 19 – Met with Jeff Lemley and his brother around 10:00PM in the Skookum Meadows area to do some late night call blasting. By the time I got there they had already tried a couple of sets. It was quite foggy, but the sound still carried well, with echoes lasting a few seconds after the source stopped. This is the best time to blast out these sounds, late evening, early morning in the fog since the air is quite dense at this time. Interestingly enough, the primates that do use long type calls for communications between members also choose this time of the day to do so.  Jeff and Alan Terry have built themselves quite an impressive sound blasting system. It is modular and has very good output. The sound was clear, I heard no distortion or feedback during the blasts he made. It ran off his car battery. I was quite tired and didn’t last too long sitting outside with Jeff and company in the cold, I crawled back into my truck around 11:30PM and quickly fell asleep. My day job work shift gets me out of bed at 2:30AM and I usually work 10 hour days. I was starting this out all wrong.  Jeff woke me around midnight and said that they were going back home and that they had heard nothing while I was sleeping. I thanked them for meeting with me and bringing the equipment. I watched them leave. I quickly went back to sleep.  Oct 20 – I woke at my usual time – 2:30AM (great!) and started to drive the back roads, visiting the Skookum Meadows Expedition base camp, hill top and ridge top sites as well as the cast site. I wanted to take some measurements, get another average GPS reading after the military eliminated the scramble signal at the cast site and just have a look at the general area during hunting season.  One deer and a lone coyote, evidenced by their tracks had visited the cast site. I collected a soil sample, documented the cast site with pictures, GPS and did some tape measurements.  I found some interesting things traveling around the area this trip:  · A skid mark, looking very much like a human buttock on a road side bank, complete with what might have been hand prints and three impressions that hinted at being bare footprints – 16.5” long x 6” wide at the ball and with toes.· At the exact spot where, during the expedition, I had been filmed looking at some heat tracks on the road with the thermal imager and where I cut open a melon fruit, I found a bee hive, broken in two. It was a natural hive. I couldn't think of why a bear would carry a hive around like this only to suck on it out in the open on a dirt road. There were more large human shaped tracks leading down the road side embankment nearby.· Along the roads, on the side banks, I found 20’ – 25’ fir trees growing half way up. Large human shaped tracks led up to a spot behind these trees and then back down to the road. Some stomping around behind the trees was evident. This lead me to envision something treking up these small slopes, evading night time drivers, returning to the roadway only after passing.· Someone had been leaving fruit...  I photographed these findings and casted a track. Track found near Skookum Meadow.Second track found near Skookum Meadow. I stayed in the area till around 4:00PM, leaving for my next camp spot… Estacada Oregon, the famous Glen Thomas site. I had arranged to have Joe Beelart guide me to the exact location. I could not have asked for a better person to go with. Joe is a wealth of information about this river drainage. I spent the night at a rest stop in Estacada waiting for morning and the meet up with Joe. I worked on my notes and downloaded all the digital pictures taken so far. I also cleaned all my camera lenses. Oct 21 – 7:00AM Met with Joe who took me to a local bakery for a donut and coffee, then traveled up the Clackamas River for what seemed like forever... but it sure wasn’t boring! There were hot springs along the sides of the river, deep gorges, high cliffs… I was really impressed. The trip was about 80 miles in from Portland.  Arriving at the rock scree site around 10:00AM, we walked the final 1/3 mile. I wanted to videotape Joe describing the site and the evidence. This evidence is in the form of 6’ deep pits dug into these rock screes and the removed 100lb+ rocks neatly stacked nearby.  John Green wrote about this site in his 1971 book “On the Track of the Sasquatch”, pages 63 – 66. He had brought along his son on that trip and photographed him standing in one of these pits. I photographed Joe in the exact same hole. Later I matched up some of the rock faces with the picture John Green put in his book. Some rocks are missing from the piles but it didn't look like any new ones appeared.Joe told me that further up the hill, in other rocky areas, there may be as many as a hundred of these pits and rock cairns. They had also found things that looked like long mounds in these rocks, thinking it might be a burial site, he contacted local authorities and was told not to mess with them. He has several theories in his head right now concerning them:  · These possible burial mounds would eventually collapse when the body decomposed and was eaten by the many small rodents living under these rocks, leaving no tell-tale evidence. Maybe what we really need is one of those fiber optic camera attachments to look under these rocks. · Local Indian archeological sites have nothing that looks like these pits and cairns. They would not build anything at that altitude nor that exposed to the weather. The high side of the pits I saw were on the southern side.One the trip back down into Estacada, one of my Ride-Rites (a small air bag type of shock absorber for my camper-truck combination) lost a bolt and popped out while driving. It rubbed against the inner tire and produced a lot of blue rubber burning smoke then quickly lost air. We fixed the situation with some rope Joe had brought along and continued down the mountainside, loosing maybe just 30 minutes.  My next stop was a visit with TP at his home, which Joe led me to, arriving around 5:30PM.  T, CO and myself shared a campfire on his back property discussing Sasquatch in general...  T informed me that he had been working through the summer (his teaching vacation) for the Forest Service. He had approached them about using remote cameras to document local wildlife. They were interested in Wolverine and bought 10 cameras for the program he had laid out to them. T got some real good experience with this project.  Oct 22 – Well to get that Ride Rite fixed I had to spend 4 hours sitting at the Clackamas Les Schwab Tire Store. But not a penny came out of my pocket. They even had to replace the tire.  My next stop was back up in Washington, at J P’s home. The drive up to his place was uneventful except for the fact of seeing the area where many sightings and track finds have been recorded. It is an area I will definitely go back to, and soon.  I arrived at J's around 9:00PM. Before turning in for the night I just had to show him the video from Estacada, so we hooked it up to his big screen TV. It looks like I am going to need to practice a lot more with that camera. Talk about amateur!  Oct 23 – J took me up into his study areas this morning and I was quite impressed. We encountered some River Otters sharing a large fish in a stream closed to all but foot travel. We spent a couple of hours just sitting and glassing a hillside at around 2800’ elevation.  There are many rivers in this area that have excellent banks to look for tracks on. Some are quite close to his home. "
5251," Piute Mountain region of the Sequoia National Forest, located 20 miles southeast of Lake Isabella. Our campground (Saddle Spring) was located 5.7 miles north of Piute Peak (campground). The coordinates of our campsite were 35 31.185 N, 118 24.748 W; at an elevation of 6,866 ft."
6734,"I may have stumbled onto a print by pure accident, while hiking with my niece and nephew in the Siuslaw Natl. Forest, west of Dallas, Or. I will give details of the location later, as not to saturate the site with the public, so I can finish my investigation in the area and get more readings and data... GPS, photos, and history on the area... Here is what I have thus far....On the mid afternoon of 24 July, I took my niece age 13, and nephew age 16, to an area I used to hunt and log about 30 years ago west of Dallas, Oregon. Thirty years has changed the area quite a bit as Weyerhauser has bought up a lot of the land, Boise and Hampton Co. as most of the area is logged out, there is still a large standing area of some old growth and an area in which to hike. We were not 15 min. out from my truck on a trail and my nephew blurted out... ""Uncle Ron, look at this foot print!""  Off the trail a foot or two was a large print made in dried mud, (the last rain in the area was about 6 July 2003), so the print was well defined and clear as the photo shows. Several things I noticed about the print,1) It was not a boot print as no boot tracks were showing, the print was smooth, consistent with a bare foot print. 2) The width was about 9 inches wide at the largest width, and about 14 inches long. 3) Toe contours could clearly be seen, but it looks like what ever made he print may have stepped on a twig, wood, so not all the toes made an imprint in the mud, as the casting shows.4) The foot print clearly shows a heel print, and arch in the foot, the edge of the foot at wide proportions from a very heavy individual. 5) As the trail is used lightly by mountain bikers and horses, as seen by tracks on the trail. Our 5 hours up on the trail, I only saw one mountain biker that day while in the area. So, it is not used that much, maybe only by locals who live in Dallas or people who know the area.I attempted to make GPS readings that day, but for some reason, my GPS could not pick up satellite signals possibly from the heavy canopy of trees. Another attempt for a long/lat reading with negative results on a second trip. I will attempt a 3rd trip with new batteries and see what happens.The print was, as I said, left of the trail, going SSW. I searched the area for about 2 hours, hair samples on trees, scat, or other prints in area...negative results...photos of area were taken from different perspective points. At this point, as I dont want to ""contaminate"" the area with undue traffic, I will keep the exact location confidential until I complete my investigation. Now a little history on the area. I have hunted the Falls City and Dallas area since 1970. In 1972, while heading to Falls City, Or. my friend Rick swerved to miss something darting across the road... I was a witness to something large, tall and running on two legs, not four....thinking it may have been a bear, or a crazed hunter dressed in black... we both, as teenagers could not answer what we saw... The stories we had heard is, that the Dallas and Falls City area from old timers, and hunter friends of ours, stories of BIGFOOT circulated during that time... especially after the famous RED BLUFF, Ca. film clip of the famous Roger Patterson... from 1967.As the photo shows I took a casting of the footprint, as mentioned, only one was found thus far. Within the next few days I will attempt to return to the area for further investigation and findings. Will keep you posted... You do have my permission to post this report and photos... At this point, ""undetermined what made the print""At his point only two other Bigfoot Research Websites have been contacted on this sighting, no response as of yet. My friend RAY CROWE has highly recommended your site and organization for years. I first met Ray Crowe at a seminar he did on BIGFOOT in 1994. I am also a good friend of Lyle Vann of the Arizona Bigfoot Center Paulden, Az. "
7504,"Well this was just supposed to be a fishing trip to see what the area had to offer.  I had been coming to this area for the past couple of months and started to learn it a little better.  So I decided to go exploring for some fishing holes.  All I had with me at the time was a fishing rod and a GPS receiver so I wouldnt get lost.  I parked the truck and started out on foot. I had talked to two local fishermen about what was in these rivers, and what to use. Im from the south and this area was like a new world.  So I made my way down to the river along the side of the bank.  At times the going got a little hard but I managed.  I tried several places but the water was moving too fast, so I thought that I would try and find a slack part of the river, where the flow was a little slower.  Now these woods are a lot different than the ones I was used to, so I was a little excited about this new area. I had been walking for maybe 45 minutes and covered maybe two miles when I saw something in the distance.  At first I thought that it was just a stump, seeing that I had left my glasses in the truck.  Now my vision isnt that bad, but I still need them for driving.  But, I started feeling a little uneasy due to an earlier encounter, plus it might have been a bear. But, being the idiot that I am, I had to get closer.  I got to within about 75 yards, because I was using the tree line as cover. That was as close as I wanted to get.  You could say that my heart was beating out of my chest it was like I had buck fever.  Well now that I was within good sight of the creature. It was easy to see what it was.  It finally stood up, and I didnt know up until that point how big it really was.  Now, I had a roommate who was 6'7 and this creature would have easily stood over him.  At the best guess I would have to say that it was 7'6 tall, and it had to weigh over 400lbs.  It finally turned to me and made me out in a second, but when it turned, it didnt run away instantly.  It just stood there.  I guess it was trying to see what I was. We must have looked at each other for 10 seconds or so, but it felt like 10 minutes. And in that time all I could see was that the creature had dark reddish brown hair, and the arms easily hung down to the creatures knees. But within an instant something spooked it. The creature turned and looked down river, and it just took off.  Now the ground that this thing covered was amazing.  I didnt move for a good bit, because I was in shock.  After the creature had left, I did the same, once I could get my feet working again. "
9142,"Hi,I am from Pinawa, Mb.  I flew in Adventure Air out of PINE FALLS. I sat in the front seat with headphones on .I fly at least 6 times per Summer in the same Beaver bush plane.I am always watching for Moose, and Bear. I spotted this object, it was moving, it took a bit to realize it was not a Moose or a bear.The object was totally upright, walked like a person, approached the road from the South and crossed the highway.  It walked straight as an arrow, across the road, thru the low ditch and by this time I was looking back toward it, and saw it dissapear into the bush.I was quite a distance, and could not see moving legs or arms. It was dark in color. I did not realize until it was into the middle of the highway, that this was something unusual. I did not tell the pilot til after, as we had passengers and would have had to go a ways out of his way to try and get a closer look.I looked at the highway there were no vehicles parked or moving. This is a very isolated highway. I will probably talk to the pilot, he crosses this area often. May be able to get some GPS readings. In hindsight I wish I had shown the pilot, because I watched it for about 30 seconds. "

12418,"I am new to this stuff, so I won't even try to cover everything related to this trip. That's for others to talk about. I can tell about what I observed and heard. There were about twenty five people at the BFRO's Jemez Mts. expedition in northern New Mexico a few weeks ago. Several things happened during the expedition. I'll only describe what I observed personally, from where I was standing or sitting at the time.If you were on this trip, and you don't see me mentioning the other incidents that happened closer to your positions, then please write them up yourself. This is what I personally experienced.Pam R.Albuquerque, New Mexico[Portions below are edited by BFRO editors]Thursday, August 11th: Day : Bright and SunnyI, along with my sister our two boys, followed the expedition group along mountain roads near the first base camp to help find views over elk grazing areas where the guides could blast and listen. Several good spots were found and noted by GPS units. All of were at high elevations and had breathtaking views across vast mountain forests and canyons. The guides needed to see as many of these locations as possible while it was still light, so we kept moving most of the time. We explored these mountains for hours and only passed two other vehicles and one ranch house.Night : Rainy and WindyMost people headed out for the view locations visited during the day.   My sister and another lady remained at the base camp to rest and listen for sounds in that area. Blasting at first location :  Nothing heard. There was a lot of wind and rain from the west.  No animals were heard responding to the blasts, not even coyotes or owls.  The decision was made to move around to the east facing slope, away from the winds.Blasting at second location : We heard some things.Unlike at the first blasting location, there was very little wind and rain on this side of the mountain. The guides said the east side of the mountain would get the usual afternoon rain coming up from the Gulf of Mexico, but it was pretty sheltered from the storms blowing in from the west. There was only a slight drizzle once we got up on the east slope, and there were patches of fog hanging in the gullies. My two boys (Nick and Will), and I drove past the blasting site (#2) about 1/4 mile (using left fork in road at blasting site). One boy was asleep in the bed of the pickup truck. Around the first curve, the headlights lit up a small cloud of dust swirling in the road, as if an animal has just got off the road in a hurry. We drove slowly through the dust swirl. The ground was too rocky and gravelly for tracks. Not far beyond the swirl of dust, a bank of thick fog covered the road. We drove into the fog bank and pulled up to a clearing on the left, about 1/4 mile up the road from the blasting crew. We stopped and shut off all lights. Both boys were in the bed of the pickup truck and I was inside with the windows down. I heard nothing for a while. After a few minutes, the boys said they heard the sounds of sticks breaking inside the tree-line.  The fog was too thick for us to see inside the tree-line. The source of the sound did not seem to move. There were occasional branch snapping sounds coming from one direction. This lasted for about two minutes. We could hear the blasts from down the road, but heard no responses to the blasts. After about an hour of hearing nothing more, we drove back down to the blasting team. At the blasting site I continued to listen for several minutes. I was very tired by now and cold.  I needed to relieve myself, and I'm female, so I turned on a flashlight and marched up the road just far enough away to find some privacy.I walked in the opposite direction of where we had seen the dust swirl in the road. When I rounded the first curve in that direction, I was ""hit"" with a series of low pitched growls (about 7 or 8) that seemed to come from the tree line directly ahead of me. I stopped for a few seconds to make sure of what I was hearing. The growls were distinct, but very low pitched and just barely audible. I could feel the hum of the growls in my chest area. It seemed like I could feel the sounds better than I could hear them. Then, there was a louder growl which I could hear much better. That caused me to run back to the truck and my boys.  I went toward the truck and whispered to Nick and Mike that I had been growled at. We walked back toward where I had heard the growls. On the way down Mike stopped me and said he saw movement in the brush. I heard branches snapping in the same direction. The three of us moved back to the truck and tried to call the others via the walkie-talkie.As I fiddled with the radio I heard loud moos and bellows from some cows in a gully below us. I had the impression that they were spooked by something. I got in the pickup truck to warm up. Nick walked with Mike Sedillo and the other guys down to where the leg of a young deer was found in the road.  Will and I sat bundled up in the vehicle with the windows down. After 20 or 30 minutes we heard a wild clamor of fighting coyotes in the woods uphill from us.Among the fray of coyote sounds was something odd.  It was a strange yowling. It stood out among coyotes'  yips, yaps, and snarls. It sounded more like a human or an ape. This went on for about 45 seconds and then died down. I think a few people near the blasting area recorded it.  [See the link to the sound clip at the bottom of the page]People were spread out at bit. Other people heard sounds that I did not hear from where I was. Many were distant sounds, some were closer. There were lots of different animal noises in this area (frogs, coyotes, owls, cattle, elk, etc.) compared to almost no animal sounds near the first blasting area. It was getting very cold around 2:30 am.  The plan for the next day was discussed. It was obvious that there was a higher concentration of animals in this area compared to the first area. About six or seven people, including me, insisted that we also heard something that was not a 'known' animal. Everyone agreed that we should focus on this area, and move the base camp closer to this area.Friday morning, August 12 : Packed up Base Camp #1. Everyone helped pull up camp near the first blasting location, and relocate it closer to where the sounds were heard the night before. Friday night, August 13 :At Base Camp #2 the guides recommended that we blast Tahoe screams and Ohio howls and some other sounds from base camp that evening, because the sounds would echo through the area where we were the night before. They said if what we heard the night before was actually a sasquatch, the blasts would likely attract it toward the base camp. After the second blast a short but distinct ""return call"" was heard. It sounded very similar to the Tahoe recording, which is what they were using to blast with at that moment.Some of the other people who heard it said (over the walkie-talkies) that it might have been a loud echo of the Tahoe recording. They radioed for Ed to blast it again, to see if they could hear the ""echo"" again.  After a few tries, there was agreement that what was heard originally could not have been an echo, because we could not reproduce it.Within 30 minutes or so, some of the other people said they could hear something walking in the woods on the north side of camp. There was some talk about how to respond to this, so as not to scare off whatever was stalking the camp, but rather to encourage it to come closer. I didn't get to hear those sounds. My own tent was about 100 yards away from that group (Los Alamos team). What they heard at that point, and later on, is for them to tell. Saturday morning, August 12: We returned to blasting area #2 during the day and searched the area where Mike and Nick said they had been paralleled through the woods by something. We found some freshly overturned aspen trees and cow bones. We also found the spot where I think the growls had come from.  Lots of possible impressions. The ground and leaf litter was too thick to make any identification of tracks. Saturday around sundown, August 12: The group I was with drove up the road beyond blasting area #2 and dropped off five of us (Nick, Will, Mike, Pam (me), and Brooke) to walk the road downhill.  The drivers moved the vehicles ahead to make various sounds from their positions. They gave warnings over the radios, then made a particular sequence of sounds which they have heard in other areas. We could hear it clearly from our position. Everyone stood still and silent and listened for responses. There was no immediate response. After about twenty minutes the sequence was repeated. Within a few seconds we heard at least two faint, womanish shrieks in the distance. The shrieks frightened my extremely skeptical sister. We assured her that those noises were peanuts compared to the ones the night before.We listened for another twenty minutes and heard nothing. It started to rain so we drove back down to Base Camp #2. It was not far down the hill.Blasts made from the base camp could be heard from this area, so we figured we could lure it toward the base camp by blasting a few times from there.We went back and blasted from base camp. For about an hour we heard no responses, so we turned in for the night. While in our tents, the four of us, who were camped farthest away from the other tents, heard whistle noises coming from the woods on the slope above us. There was more than one whistler and there might have been three.  They were not whistling continuously. It was an occasional back and forth exchange, but this went on for about an hour and we probably heard about 30 or 40 different whistles. They were definitely not elk whistles, and were too variable in tone and pitch to be bird. They sounded more like short, soft human whistles calling back and forth to each other as they moved to different parts of the hillside.I fell asleep eventually but then awoke to the sound of two loud, heavy footsteps directly outside the tent. I thought at first that someone from the group had silently approached our tent and expected to hear someone call our names. I whispered to my sister, ""Did you hear that?"" She tapped me on the shoulder twice, which I thought was a signal to go back to sleep. As it turns out, she was trying to tell me that she had heard it as well and wanted me to simply be quiet and listen some more. I  went to sleep, and heard no more sounds that night.The next day several people took time to look around the hillside where the whistles were heard. Several possible tracks had been found on a different part of that hillside the day before. More were found on Sunday. Bill and Brooke from San Francisco cast a few those. Some brush structures were found and photographed. I'll leave it to the others to tell about the other things they heard and found. "
12904,"The BFRO Colorado Expedition was conducted in a remote area in the same part of Colorado as some major ski areas -- Vail, Ski Cooper, and Breckenridge. The area was heavily forested and had plenty of water. The expedition was well planned and was executed well. The majority of the participants arrived at the initial base camp location on 8 Sept and individual camps (groups of two-three) were positioned along the drainage.  We had all been briefed on the history of sightings, tracks, and vocalizations in the area,  and the methods we'd use to determine their presence. We spread out that evening, stayed in touch via walkie talkie, and conducted wood knocking and calling in an coordinated manner. We had night vision devices, recording devices, and IR detection equipment.  We worked well into the early morning hours (2 AM). Nothing was heard.  The next morning (9 Sept) the guides said we should move the base camp to another target area, because we would have heard any sasquatches the night before if they were in that drainage. We drove a few hours to a new location across the Continental Divide.  The night of 9 Sept was spent in canyon near the new base camp.  Participants were positioned a half mile to quarter mile intervals (I think) with the sound blaster positioned in the middle of the group. The calls and wood knocks announced and timed so as not to be confused with a response. Nothing was heard.The next day (10 Sept.), the focus moved to a different canyon, near where some possible vocalizations were heard the night before by one of the guides. A group of five or six worked the top of the drainage from well above the timber line and hiked down in the direction of the base camp.  Two others worked the road on ATVs above the valley, and a few others worked the hillsides above the drainage.  I hiked up the same drainage starting from the base camp. As I was walking up the trail next to the creek, about a mile or so from camp, I was in radio contact with the group above me. We would announce when we would call or wood knock. We could hear the knocks and calls between us, but just barely. I proceeded to a fork in the trail and found an old hunting camp site that had been used in previous years but had shown no signs of recent use.  I started to take an old trail that went through the camp site when I heard two distinct and clear wood knocks to my left approximately 150 - 200 yards away at most  close enough to startle me significantly as I was by my self.  I stopped and immediately got on the radio  no one was within a mile of two of me and no one had said they were knocking.  The sound was much closer and more distinct that those made by the guys way up on the ridge above me.  After about two minutes, I picked up a large stick and made two or three loud wood knocks in reply.  I got an immediate response of two knocks that appeared to be a little farther away (maybe 300-400 yards) but still very clear.  The knocks were similar to the first I had heard but just a little farther away.  I responded again with knocks and then a whoop or two over a 30 minute period but got no additional replies.  I was alert to any movement or smells in the area but noticed none. Eventually I decided to return to base camp. After arriving at camp I linked up with a few other guys. We road ATVs to the location where I heard the knocks to investigate further.  One guy took the ATV further on the trail that forked to the left at the old camp site. He went for about .7 miles in the direction where the sound came from. He later said he noticed a musty smell in that area. The group that worked the drainage from the top had found a couple of sets of tracks (which they photographed). I saw the pictures and thought they were pretty clear. As they moved down the valley they also noticed a distinct smell about 500 yards to the left of the above referenced wood knock incident. This is the same area where Lee picked up the smell and turned around on the trail.Some things happened later that night around the base camp. I'll let the others describe those incidents. I recommend that as a prerequisite for attending expeditions, each attendee should listen closely to the Sierra Sounds CD.  I bought it after the trip and wish I had heard it before the trip. It gives a good understanding of what they sound like, the wood knocks, the vocalizations, and all. The expedition guides from the BFRO were very informative and helpful. They brought a lot of experience to the event. The guides from Colorado had extensive knowledge of the encounters in this area, including some of their own. Other attendees were witnesses from Colorado.I hope to work with the Colorado guides and the other newbies over the next year (may even be up for a trip to Wyoming). I now have a working sound blaster, and a couple of digital trail cams  enough to be dangerous.  I hope to attend some of the other expeditions over the next year (Oklahoma, Arizona or Oregon) and work with this group again. My wife thinks I have lost it. I have to get her involved. "
15197, THE SOUNDS WERE HEARD AT LAKE MORAN. [Specifics and coordinates removed from submission at the request of the witnesses]
15211,"This just happened at 2:00 a.m. this morning and I got on this website to submit it as soon as I got home from the mountains.  I need help getting this recording off of my voice activated dictation tape recorder.  Windows Sound Recorder is just not doing the job.  I submitted a previous report #1027 for an incident in Arizona in September of 2000.  The reason I even mention the previous incident was that the camcorder I was using then did not record the sounds we heard so I purchased a Bionic Ear so I wouldn't miss an opportunity in the future and in this case it proved itself invaluable.My 16 year old son and I took a camping trip into the High Uintah mountains of Utah to go camping to escape the triple digit temperatures expected for today in the lower elevations.  Our original intent was to camp at designated campsites either at Trial Lake or Lake Washington but both campsites were full and since it was starting to get dark I decided to just find a spot off a road somewhere and set up camp.  The paved road we were on ended and we stayed on the dirt road until we found a spot adjacent to Trident Lake at about the 9700 foot level that had thick, forest surrounded meadows on both sides of the road with the lower meadow encompassing Trident Lake.  We set up in the trees next to a flat, three foot high by about eight foot diameter boulder that we used as a table, just off the dirt road.  My GPS unit marks our site at 40 deg 38' 57"" North by 110 deg 57' 51"" West but Google Earth put us at 40 deg 38'57.69"" North by 110 deg 57' 49.25"" West.  We set up camp a little distance from other people who had gotten there before us, some to the north, south and a relatively large encampment at the southern end of the large upper meadow to the west of the road.  The Bionic Ear is a parabolic sound reflector with a sensitive microphone attached to it with outputs to headphones and to a recording device.  My recording device is one of those inexpensive GE Auto Voice Tape Recording machines used in meetings to record what goes on during a meeting.  I had it all hooked up, not really expecting to even use it, but at 2:00 a.m. I was violently jolted awake by a voluminous, echoing, sonar like scream and it continued as I scrambled to turn everything on.  I twisted on the rheostat knob on the Bionic Ear and in my initial fumbling with the recorder I inadvertently hit the Stop/Eject button which opened the tape door and ejected the tape.  Cursing myself, I slammed the tape back in and hit the record button and out of the five screams that I heard (not counting what it took to wake me) I managed to record the final two screams.  On the tape you can hear the screams with the dog in the adjacent campsite doing some woofs but it was subdued and not barking like I would have expected.  After the second scream, my son tries to make some sounds and you can hear me on the tape telling him to ""shut up"" because I didn't want anything interfering with this recording.  The sound was emanating from the upper meadow to the west and it was resounding off of the trees and surrounding hillsides which you can make out in the recording.  I didn't put the earphones on because I didn't need to, it was so loud, but the earphones started a feedback with the Bionic Ear after the screams had stopped so I had to move the headphones to a position on either side of my neck to stop the feedback.  I stayed awake for a while afterwards and there was no sound, not even from the other campers for about five minutes then I could hear conversations but not the content.  I could hear tree limbs breaking about half an hour after the screams and that is when I turned on the camcorder to find out what time it was and it was reading 2:38 a.m. Saturday, July 15, 2006.  When it was light I went to the other campers with the recording and several of them were not fooled into thinking that it might have been a lone coyote or something but they were initially loathe to come right out and say what they were thinking about it.  One of them said it sounded like a monster and then I said ""You think it might have been Bigfoot?"" to which I got a relieved ""Yes!""  They were very glad that I had gotten that recording because they were starting to doubt what it was they heard.  The campers at the southern end of the West meadow said the sound came from the northern end of the meadow in the trees and they thought it was a coyote, but when you hear the tape, you know that it was not a coyote.  I lived on a 700 acre ranch for several years and we heard coyotes just about every night and this was no coyote unless it was the size of a buffalo.  The people who thought it was a coyote said their own dogs did not make a peep during the screams even though they usually would and those same dogs barked at me when I came to ask these people about the sounds.  My son also informed me later that he had been hearing the sounds before I woke up to record them but he didn't want to wake me. My GPS unit marks our site at 40 deg 38' 57"" North by 110 deg 57' 51"" West but Google Earth put us at 40 deg 38'57.69"" North by 110 deg 57' 49.25"" West."

17570,"I was one of the leaders for our church Boyscout troop along for our annual week long campout high adventure. We arrived late morning July 31 at the Summit Lake Scout camp at the summit of Disautel pass located on the Colville confederated tribes reservation this is just a short ways off state route 155 in between Nespelem and Omak. I would like to give you as much information leading up to the incident of the evening of August 1st as I believe they are all related. After arriving and getting the lodge setup. We decided to take a hike. Though we had some planned hikes loaded in our handheld GPS we decided to just pick an open ridge about two miles distant and hike up to it sticking to no trails or roads just bushwacking. We had to skirt a logging operation which was clearing some thick timber on some very steep slopes using helicopters, to ferry the logs down the slope to more accesable sites to transport it. There was lots of fresh bear sign as there were wild Blueberries and huckleberries on the lower slopes.The next morning we planned a hike to a lake about 6 miles from our camp the lake is called grant lake I believe? We hiked south down SR 155 to the coyote creek camp ground then to the right down the asphalt rd about a mile into an area where we were supposed to have a permit to enter. We had the coordinates for the lake loaded into the GPS so we just went cross country until we arrived at the lake it was about 2 miles from the coyote creek camp ground. It is a small crescent shaped lake there was an old hunting camp with a tipi frame and an old travel trailer at one end. We spent the day napping and talking and the boys swam in the lake and ran around as boys are want to do. It was a nice day we had decided to camp overnight, we had no fires as the area was quite dry. The only wildlife I noticed was a family of Lesser Scaup ducks and a family of Canada geese on the lake. No fresh deer sign there had been some cattle in the area fairly recently, but we saw no cattle. Around dusk I decided to take a walk up on a rocky ridge a couple hundred yards north of the lake to see if I could get cell coverage to call my wife. As I left the boys were taking an old smoking rack apart and breaking the 3-5inch diameter lodgepole pine logs that it was made of against a tree most of these were rotten so they broke fairly easy but they were making quite a racket. When I reached the top of the ridge I could hear the sharp cracks as they struck the small logs against the tree. I walked back around the opposite side of the lake back towards our camp keeping an eye out for bear as I know they would start to move around dark as it cooled down, though with the boys so noisy and it being drier at this lower elevation ( not many berries at all) I doubted there were any around. But I felt a little uneasy for some reason?? So I headed back to our camp. As I approached the camp just before dark I smelled a musty smell like a pack rats den but stronger one of the other leaders commented yeah there is definately a skunk around. But it wasnt a skunk smell not that pungent just musty. So anyway I'm getting to the incident. We got the boys mostly settled and lights out in their sleeping bags about 10-11:00 O'clock I would guess. Shortly after they quieted down there was loud two part call with tremendous volume it was not man made it stated out lower then went to a high crescendo then followed by a shorter lower call. It did not sound like any of your recordings the closest sound I have found on the internet is the call of a male ibbon I believe some kind of Ape. It whatever it was repeated this call three or 4 times and got futher away each time the sound came from a draw at the north end of the lake where the soil was moist and there was fairly thick brush. I spend alot of time outdoors hiking hunting, and fishing. I have never heard anything like this sound. We had to help one of the boys who had found a leech on him. This was a few minutes after the call.I asked the boys did you hear that noise. They all said yeah what the heck was that. I said I have no idea never heard it before. A couple of the boys joked maybe it's bigfoot. I never really put everything together until later when I got home and the boys comment got me to thinking about the bigfoot possibilty. So I searched the Internet for bigfoot sounds and found your sight.After reading most all of the accounts there are some things that many of the other sightings include.I believe with the logging going on maybe this animal whatever it was was displaced from the thick timber up higher maybe it was attracted by the boys cracking the logs aginst the tree, and the musty smell shortly before the call. This call was very load and powerful and clear. "

22598,"I lived in the High Desert of California in Ridgecrest, CA in Kern County from 1980 to 1985. I did a lot of hiking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I never saw or heard anything unusual during that time. MY Mom, Sister (& Family), and Brother and his Family still live there. My 19 year old son and I were visiting various family members from Sept 17 through Sept 27 2007 in Ridgecrest, CA. My sister took me and my son up to the Siebert family gold mine, cabin, and mining equipment on the 24th of September. We had spent about an hour at this location and we were preparing to leave. My sister was in the Port-a-Potty and my son and I heard this high pitch scream like a woman hollering, and it sounded just like the ones we heard on your sight. Just like the sound that was reported in the BFRO Report # 9426 (Class B), which is only 7 miles from that site. We yelled back thinking it was a woman in trouble and there was no reply. I asked my sister if she heard it she said no. I told her what we heard and she told me that she had horse backed and hiked through this area and had never heard anything that would make that kind of sound. She has lived and in this area since 1980. I asked her Husband whos an avid hunter, horseback trail rider and hiker in these mountains and he said that he knew of no animal that made a high pitch scream in this area. My brother- in-law also has lived in Ridgecrest, CA area all of his life. In searching for the animal that made this sound on the internet, I found this site with the sound that I had heard. It is located in Kern County, up Indian Wells Canyon Rd, off California Highway 14, at Latitude 35°41'47.44""and Longitude N117°57'54.36""W, near Owens Peak. "
24371,"I drove up Mill Creek Road to Tiger Creek Road (also called Tiger Canyon Road) and stopped at Skyline Campground (formerly squaw springs campground). I live in western Washington but grew up in Walla Walla and love the Blue Mountains. Im an avid hiker and love to enjoy the outdoors. When I get the time I like to make a hiking trip. I hadnt been to this particular site before but I had heard some of the Sasquatch stories coming out of the Tiger Canyon area. I had driven up Tiger Canyon a couple times before, including a few weeks prior in late June when the road was still blocked by snow. I thought this campground would be the perfect place to stay the night and hike the area. A friend of mine had been with on the trip when the road was blocked, but he too was busy this week so I went alone to scout out the area alone, stay the night and drive back to western Washington the next day.I had first been intrigued by the idea of Sasquatch when I found some info online while searching for hiking sites. As a kid some local friends had told me stories, but Id never been sure what to make of it. I also had read a book about Blue Mountain Bigfoot that Vance Orchard had wrote. I wasnt totally convinced that these creatures existed and did not think I would find anything about them because I figured that if there were encounters, they were very rare.I arrived at the campground at about one oclock. An older couple was there reading, enjoying the campground. I picked an area and began set up my tent. As I was pounding the stakes in I felt something hit the ground behind me. I turned around and I didnt see anything. I looked over at the couple and they were still sitting at their campsite. Whatever it was had caused a very strong vibration in the ground behind me and it couldnt have been anyone at the camp.A little bit later I started to hear a weird noise. At first I thought it was the antifreeze bubbling in my car because it was a hot day and my car was steaming a little. My car overheats a lot. The sounds were like a low rumbling growl. It was a sustained sound that lasted for just a couple seconds. However I seemed to hear it in regular intervals. The sound also seemed to kind of echo like the sound of something hollow or the sound of water down a drain which is why at the time I thought it was my car.I decided to explore the area; I walked by the two other campers and said hi. They had a poodle that barked at me little. I wanted to see if I could look over Tiger Canyon at the valley from where we were so I crossed over to the other side if Kendall Skyline Road. I couldnt see much through all the trees so I decided to head the other way. I brought a GPS device with me that had topography maps loaded on it. It showed a trail into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness that I wanted to follow. As I started in that direction I noticed a very large track just to the right of a pool of water in some soft mud. It didnt really look to me as something authentically Bigfoot because the foot seemed thin. I told myself it couldnt be a footprint of a Sasquatch because I had read some stories a few weeks earlier and thought I could just be imagining it.I came back and looked around the area behind the camp where I had felt the thump. I had heard something knocking on a tree so I tried to make noise like I had done when I was hammering the tent posts. I had a little pattern of sorts that I thumped onto the ground with a rock. It seemed like at one point whatever it was mimicked the pattern of my thumps. I explored the area I thought it was coming from, but only saw a deer, so I figured maybe it was just my imagination getting the best of me. The noises stopped and I felt relieved. It was all just in my head I thought.It was now somewhere between 1:30 pm and 2 pm, and I started down towards Squaw Spring. I noticed some more prints as I walked but I still didnt believe what I was seeing. I found some that seemed to continue on further but I did not follow them since I had planned to go a few miles into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness and didnt want to waste time. It also looked like there was a foot impression on a log that had fallen across the spring. This all seemed too surreal to me because there were lots of prints everywhere even some that appeared smaller, possibly a juvenile animal, but they were just thin outlines. I had never seen prints like these in person so I was unsure what I was even looking at.I kept walking and came to a clearing on the side of a grade where I found a print that was about 3 inches deep and well defined. I could see the big flat foot, the toes and heel. Suddenly I thought wow these prints are for real. I now had a feeling one of these creatures could be around any corner. I got to the top of one of the mountains to get a nice view of the wilderness area and then made my way back to camp.When I got back I was pretty tired from hiking. The two other people at the campground left in their pickup shortly after I got there and I went to relax in my tent. I was the only one at the campground now. About an hour later I heard the same low rumbling growl sound from earlier. I realized that my car had now been off for 3 or 4 hours, and there was really no way it could be the car. I was hearing more knocking and like I had earlier. It sounded like someone was smacking a branch against a tree. I realized whatever creature this was; it must be the same one that came by before because the knocking and the low growl started at the same time after being silent for so long. It sounded like it was in the same area behind my campsite where I had heard the thump earlier. It was now about 7 pm, about 2 hours until dark. Being there by myself made me very nervous, especially with the growling noise and tree knocking apparently being directed toward me and my campsite. I got out of there as fast as I could.I got back to town and felt very paranoid. I spent time walking downtown Walla Walla calming myself down and recounting the events. I had never been so scared of the outdoors. People noticed I looked visibly shaken though I had not mentioned the incident. It was hard to even tell anyone in fear of them thinking I was crazy. I set up camp at Skyline Campground (formerly Squaw Springs Campground)It is along Kendall Skyline Road. Take Mill Creek Road to Tiger Creek Rd and it is 2 or 3 miles south of where Tiger Creek Rd intersects Kendall Skyline Rd. I hiked approximately 2 miles into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness. I also brought along a Garmin GPS and kept a log of my hike if someone wants to investigate the area further."

25703,"In November 1996 just a couple of days before thanksgiving my best friend and I were camping and deer hunting on Weyerhaeuser forestry land in SE Oklahoma the nearest town would be Smithville but even at that it would somewhere around 9 miles as the crow flies. (Land has since been sold to John Hancock Corp). This area is in the same general area as where my written report occurred.This area is used to grow soft pine trees for harvesting to grind into paper pulp. The total area is something around 800,000 acres. So you can imagine how big of an area this is. There are no homes or anyone living in this area at all, in fact you are not even allowed to build any permanent hunting cabins or such things.By this time of 1996 I had actually all but given up gun deer season, I was almost strictly a bow hunter. About 3 years before I was actually in a tree stand and had a bullet go over my head. Some idiot was out there somewhere (never seen him heard the shot but never seen the guy that pulled the trigger) anyway he was out there just taking pot shots. I had decided after that I would just stay with my bow hunting. However my buddy wanted me to go with him as he was alone, so I decided to go ahead and accompany him.The area that we camped in is an area that is very difficult to get to and rarely does anyone go into this area. You have to exit off a logging road and travel up this very steep clear cut that climbs up a small mountain. There is really not even a road as such that you have to travel along. At one time the loggers just took a dozer and cut a path the width of the dozer from the bottom of the mountain all the way up and then along the crest of the mountain. And this path is never maintained so it gets very rough and only a 4x4 can get through and even with that you have to drive at a speed little more than walking speed.This path travels about 3 miles and simply dead ends just at the start of the downward side of the mountain. Me and my buddy call it the dish. We call it that because you are traveling up this mountain in heavy forest make a curve then suddenly you are facing down and at the bottom is a area that very much resembles a satellite dish where it is void of trees and the concave shape of the ground gives the impression of a satellite dish. This clear area is about 30 feet or so in diameter.So anyway we make the journey up the mountain and take the treacherous path up to the dish. There we make our camp and it of course becomes our home away from home for the next few days. It was a bit odd this year because normally you see one or two hunting camps once you enter the area from the highway. But this time we seen not one camp or hunter. Now to take note the dish from the highway is 14 miles, now of course that is not straight line miles because you know how access and logging roads rarely run straight for any distance.On day 3 of our hunting trip we get up before daylight as usual and get ready to go out into nature and see if we find any deer. After all, that was why were there, even so I had seen nothing the previous two days but didnt really care because as usual I very much was enjoying myself with the flora and fauna. I am also very interested in geology and there is much to see in that area. To imagine that area at one time was a shallow sea never ceases to amaze me. I wish when I took my first geology course in college I would have changed my major and pursued that field further.Oh sorry there got off track didnt I.We decide which directions we were going and we plan for our rendezvous back at the dish for 12 noon. We walk together for about ½ mile camp and there we split up my buddy continues to the west along the top of the mountain and I head south down the side of the mountain.Being that it was not yet daylight and these woods are very thick and dangerous to walk in during the daylight hours due to the rough rocky terrain I was not about to do any walking until first light so after we split I only walked about 10 yards or so and sat down and waited for a few more minutes until sun up.At sun up I get up and start my hunt, I normally am not a stalker for a couple of reasons to be a successful stalker you must have coordination to walk and not make noise also you really need a lot of stamina. I possess neither of those traits. So I normally hunt from some type of stand.But I had sat for several hours the evening before and was ready to move, plus I wanted to do some exploring into a saddle I had never been into before so this day I decided to stalk.NOTE:I am using the term saddle here and will continue using that term; however it really is not a saddle as such.A saddle is the gap between where 2 mountains run close together. This area is on the same mountain but it has two ridges (or fingers extending out away from the mountain) making a gap and valley in between these two parallel fingers much like a saddle.Imagine if you will, make a fist with your left hand, then after you make a fist extend your index and middle finger out like you are making the peace sign. Your hand is the mountain and your two extended fingers are these fingers that extend out from the mountain. The width of this finger is I am guessing somewhere around 150 yards, but could not see all the way through because of the trees (more on this further below).I will be walking down that eastern finger which in the above example would be your middle finger. Your index finger will be the western finger or ridge.(I hate using the term ridge it is too vague).The distance between these two fingers were only about 50 yards apart at the mountain and by the time you get out to the tips they are nearly a hundred yards apart.So the technically are not parallel either they do diverge some. And the length of the finger I am on is about 300 yards. The length of the western finger is about 370 yards.Never went up there so I have no clue how wide across it is. Also the crest of that finger is about 20  30 yards higher than the one I am on.END OF NOTEI start walking down the mountain side and after about a half hour I reach the eastern finger of the saddle. I sit for a few minutes to rest and catch my breath before taking out down this finger of the saddle. On this finger I could view the saddle valley to my right and also could see the eastern side of the western finger of the saddle.From the top of the finger I was walking I could see very clearly down to the bottom of the saddle which was no more than 100 feet to the floor nearest the mountain and as you walked the top of the finger away from the mountain this finger sloped downward toward the valley so that by the time the finger ended the valley within the saddle was no more than 50 feet from the peak of the finger to the valley within the saddle.So from my 12 oclock position to 180 degrees to my right (clockwise) I had a totally unobstructed view. With the exception of the trees in the saddle valley. But I had a clear enough view that if a deer was in there or came through that valley there was no way I would miss seeing it.This particular course also gave me a good look at the western finger face although with many trees on it there were several spot that had no trees and the rock strata was exposed which would give me a chance to look at to see If I could distinguish the types of rock there. I could also watch the ridge top of the western finger and see anything coming over the top.Over to my right across the top of this finger is heavily wooded with mainly hardwoods however there were some pine trees among them. This is old growth trees some of the hardwood (oaks, hickory) are quite large. It is heavily wooded enough that even in the bright sun it is fairly dark in there only a few feet in.Not dark enough that you cant see but you certainly would not need sun glasses in there. It, just like up in the dish it gets dark in there long before the sun is fully set. There is very little under growth in this area because it is so sunlight challenged. And the spacing between trees are fairly wide so that if anything of any size moved through you would have no trouble sighting it.This tree line extends almost all the way to the edge of the finger. You would only have maybe 5 feet of space to walk the length of the finger clear of trees. From the edge of this finger I am on in some places are straight down into the valley below. The only way to get on this finger is from the direction I came or as I will speak to later would be from the very end or tip of this finger.So I slowly stalk down this finger, keeping just inside the tree line so as not to be exposed to the valley floor and the western finger. I stalk very slowly along in no hurry whatsoever. Understanding that stalking means walk a few steps stop, wait, and listen, and repeat. I stalk nearly the entire length of this finger and decide I need a break so I walk out of the tree line to a spot that is actually clear of trees (except for one tree about the diameter of basketball) for about an area the size of a large bedroom.There was this very fine looking stump there that actually looked like it was made for my fat butt and it was high enough that I did not even have to bend my knees very far to be sitting. I figured I would sit for a while and rest my tired legs then I would finish walking this finger all the way to the tip and look down it and into the valley across the way.Then head back because we were to hook back up at noon and by now it was 9:30 and I was a good 3 miles from camp and a very hard climb back up the mountain. (Why in the hell did I ever decide to walk down the damn mountain, I knew I would have to walk back up at some point)?As I was sitting on my fine stump I looked down the finger out to the tip. At the tip was a huge oak tree I am 5ft 10 and it would have took two of me to wrap my arms around this thing.As I was looking at this tree and trying to figure out how a tree can grow to that size in so little soil.I then notice just off to the right of this tree a figure walking up from below the tip of the finger. The figure was in bright sunlight so I immediately recognized it as walking on two feet. And he appeared to me to be walking with his head down.But my first thought was what a dumb ass. It is deer season and if you are in hunting you are required to wear blaze orange and this guy had none. Even if you are not hunting it is a good idea if youre out in the woods.Now granted I had only seen one human in 3 days and that was my hunting buddy. And even though there were no humans for miles I for one would never take a stupid chance like that. I guess I should mention also that during the deer gun season, logging operations cease and the loggers go home. The companys do not want their employees getting plugged by some knucklehead hunter.So I knew that this guy was not a logger. Then the next question came to my mine how in the hell did this guy get there? There is no logging road in that direction for a very long way. And from the nearest road it is a long ass haul to that point. And that haul would not be easy at all in fact that area is inaccessible even by an ATV.The next thought no he is not a hunter he is not carrying a rifle nor does he have one slung on his shoulders.Now remember that all these thoughts were processed in my head in a matter of micro-seconds. While this guy was walking slowly up this slope to the top of this finger that I am on.Then the next though through my mind gosh that is a cone head (from the movie) with hair. Because his head was very pointy.Next thought my god those are big assed shoulders.Next thought why in the hell is he wearing a mink coat? WTF.Next thought did god forget to give this guy a neck? It looked to me as his head was attached directly to his shoulders.Then this guy finally reaches the top and stands directly besides that big oak I was looking at just moments ago.Next thought my god that is one big MF. I have seen many football games and some of those have been up in the nose bleed section and those guys even that high up look big.But this was different I am now 83 yards from this guy and he is the biggest person I have ever seen bar none.Then the big guy looks up and looks directly at me out in front of god and everyone. It was then I realized ok I am not looking at any man but not really animal either it didnt seem.Now let me attempt to explain what big guy did. Imagine yourself standing looking straight ahead at some target and right next to you and slightly in front of you to your right is a big tree.Your desire now is to get behind that tree with little movement as possible. What you would most likely do is simply lift your left foot and pivot 90 degrees counterclockwise on your right foot with your head and neck froze in place to watch your target while moving. That is what he done.Next thought do I have any clean underwear back at camp cause me thinks I need them.Then the flight or fight response kicked in on me but I forced myself to stop think and evaluate.I determined that at 83 yards (didnt know it was exactly 83 yards at that time I went and marked off the distance later)(I was actually guessing at the time 100 yards)there was no way no matter how fast he was, that he could cover that distance before I put at least 3 bullets in him.(However I thought later than may have only pissed him off as big as he was). But anyway when I assured myself there was no real danger I calmed down and started thinking clearly again.The big guy was now standing behind that oak watching me then suddenly he popped behind the tree and I couldnt see him. So at that point I very slowly got up and moved behind that little tree near me.Then I peeked around that basketball sized tree (BTW at that time I was beach ball size so you can see the tree really offered no concealment) to see what was happing.By the time I looked back up he was once again peeking out from behind the tree. Now this time I thought that poor guy is deformed somehow because there appeared to be some kind of growth just around and below his throat.Could not make it out but definitely could see the discoloration and could see that there was something there that didnt belong.I was straining as hard as I could to make out the facial figures of this guy but try as I might there was simply no way I could make out any details of his face. My one real regret in this whole experience.Anyway we just kind of stared at each other for a couple of seconds then he popped back behind the tree. So I done the same the best I could. Here I am in an area with trees the size of Volkswagens and leave to me to pick a sapling to hide behind.After a couple of seconds behind the tree I pop out my head dont see him but I stay in that position a couple of more seconds then the big guy pops out his head again and looks at me. Now I am really confused because the growth that seemed to be on his throat is now over on top of where a clavicle would be. I dont know what is going on it is just too far away for me to make out fine detail. Someone with better vision probably would have been able to make things out better.Now here it becomes surreal and I dont know if I can put into words the way the situation seemed to instantly change. One moment I am so tense you could not have driven a straight pin up my butt with a 16 lb sledge hammer.The very next second a calm came over me and somehow I just had a feeling that there was nothing to be concerned about. So while he was looking at me I purposely leaned my rifle up against the stump I was just sitting at with him watching me.I just got the distinct feeling (yes I know the least scientific thing in the world) that he knew that I meant no harm and had no intention of doing anything to him. Maybe not maybe I am just reading more into that than I should.For lack of a better word we basically played peek-boo for another two minutes popping back and forth behind the trees.I just got a feeling he would have liked to have gotten a closer look at me just like I wanted to with him. Of course that was never going to happen. I think we may have kept doing that for a while longer but something happened that changed the circumstance.After a total of just about 3 minutes he very suddenly snaps around the other direction?I was thinking what the heck.Then I heard what he heard very large SNAP coming from the woods on top of this finger.I peed.Then the big guy turns and keeping the tree between me and him he simply walks off. He did not run or even walk particularly fast, he was walking a bit faster leaving than he did walking in but not in any panic.I figured if it was something that made him want to leave the area I better figure out quick what that made that noise. So I pick up my rifle and immediately start scanning. I want so badly to walk over to the tip to see if I can a glimpse of big guy. But I dont dare until I resolve this issue.After a couple of minutes of searching and listening to the noise I finally track to the source of the noise maker.A frigging tank rat. Damn I missed a possible chance to get a better look at big guy because of a dang tank rat. (Dont bother looking that species up that is my personal term for an armadillo).As stated above after the incident I walked off the distance and also solved one of the mysteries. The abnormal growth on big guy was not on big guy at all. It was on the tree it was a viral knot about the size of softball.I am 5 9/10, standing under the knot I could barely touch the bottom edge of the knot with my fingers standing on my tip toes and arm extended as far as I could.I found no tracks what so ever even though I knew the exact location of where he walked up and back from, but the ground was hard pan and even a D9 bull dozer would have been hard pressed to leave any marks/tracks in that ground. "
26497,"ok, I'm 34 so what I'm about to tell you , I am still having trouble accepting, I've wondered about this since I was little. Now I KNOW,.....  August 25, 2009 my girlfriend, her two boys and I went camping at my usual spot. This location was picked due to the isolation factor; it's 10 miles up logging roads near Estacada, Oregon. I will not disclose the GPS cords. or even close to prox., This is MY spot. Nothing abnormal occured over the day or night of the 24th, and the day of the 25th was normal events like gathering wood for the coming night. We had put the boys down for the night just after sun down. We were hanging around the fire chatting and poking the fire. Being who I am, I began making noise to hear it echo through the trees. You know, rooster noises and some whooping, basic idiot noises (approx. 1130 pm). I do this at times to keep bigger game from coming through camp. Well, I got one hell of a shock about 15 minutes later. We were walking back toward the fire from the truck, the fire was only bright glowing coals at this point, and BOOM, shock to the system!!!! Out of the pitch black night....one of the most unreal sounds I've ever heard in my life came rushing through the dark. It was a hair stiffening scream that at that moment I couldn't match in my memory of noises over the 20 years I've been going into nature to escape. This was the first time in my life that I felt a need to get out of nature, QUICKLY.  The sound pushed through the trees like the trees were not even there. Even the air around us seemed to vibrate. From experience I have had in the woods through my life, and tracking sounds and distance, I'm estimating that this scream was being produced about 200 yards away. It was so loud that nothing I know of could make this big of a noise. There is no animal I have come accross that has the lungs to produce such a loud, long and vocalized sound as this ""creature"" produced. Let me put it this way....if someone told me they heard it, I would be trying to put a K9 responsible, but hearing it myself and knowing of nothing I've ever encountered could make that sound.  Now, I did not stand there much longer. I think I may have pushed my girlfriend up into the truck so I could get in ASAP. As soon as I was in, the lights were on and the horn going for about 3 seconds to try to keep it from getting closer. It seemed to work because the volume started to fade a bit. We decided to get camp up and get out. over the minutes it took us to completely tear down camp, maintain a track on movement of the screams and shove camp into the truck, the screamig continued and moved. From the time it started ,it was at 2 o'clock from the camp. While we were packing up, it moved clockwise around to about 5 o'clock from camp.  This all took about 30 minutes before we were on our way down hill. The screams continued even on our way out.  To make it completely clear, I've done alot in my life. Anything from solo hunting at the age of 12 and up to my time in the military, Iv'e never been spooked even with rounds wizzing past.....BUT that scared me to the point of every hair from the top of my toes to the top of my head were at attention! Now, after the fact, realizing what it was.....YES, I am going back with recording gear. Let me tell you, after 34 years just now experiencing what we did has completely changed my thinking process while out in these woods. "
26572,"Started on a three day hike in Gifford Pinchot National Forest on 8 Sept 09 at trail head #48 near East Crater.  After the first day of hiking into Indian Heaven Wilderness and spending a cold night at Elk Lake, I decided to hike to a lower elevation near Forlorn Lakes in which I camped on the second night (GPS N45 57.889 W 121 45.536).  I was outside a designated camping site about 200 meters west in a small valley that paralleled road Nf6035.  No one was occupying the camp grounds nearby that night and it was a very quiet night, until I was awaken with what I describe as three consecutive whooping yells followed by a guttural scream that lasted for about 3 seconds.  It was very loud.  Startled, I remember looking at my watch at the time and it was about 0230hrs.  After the whooping calls, I heard very faint distant calls or howling (not whooping).  The source of the scream was definitely coming further up valley I was camped in (maybe 200-300 meters away).  I stayed awake for a couple more hours in my tent and heard nothing more during the night.  I hiked alone for the three days, therefore no further calibration can be offered from another witness.  But I do find something interesting, the sound I heard was a very close match to the recordings of whooping sounds on this web sight.  Hope this small report helps. See report on GPS location"

27819,"Year: 2010Season: SpringMonth: MayDate: 5/12State: CaliforniaCounty: SiskiyouDirections to location: edited out, per request of the submitter.Observed: This trip was, in actuality, an expedition my brothers and myself had planned into the mountains of Siskiyou county. Our rationale came from an obscure Californian document called ""The Hermit of Siskiyou,"" which records one of the earliest Sasquatch encounters in the state as having occurred in this area.  In addition, the book also goes on to note that it was well known amongst the locals at that time that these creatures wintered in the caves, ""makes winter quarters in some of the caves of the Marble Mountains"".  We also felt that since we would, in all likelihood, be the first people into the backcountry this early in the season it would increase our chances of encountering some sort of activity.An early scouting trip on 5/10 supported our suspicions.Late afternoon on Monday, May 10th, we left our hotel in Yreka and headed out into the mountains to familiarize ourselves with the trailhead we would be using early the next morning for our hike into the valley. The weather was quite raw, chilly with cold rain. At approximately 4 pm, as we were winding up the forest service road, we came to what may be described as an overlook or turnout. We decided to pull over and get our first real look at the mountains we would be hiking into the next day. We stopped the Jeep and my two brothers bounded out of the front and began taking pictures. I was just opening the rear door on the passengers side when I suddenly heard what I can only describe as a loud and prolonged, AHHHHH!, coming from my 11 oclock from a low hill roughly 400 yards away. It was a very strange sound and completely unlike anything I had ever heard in the woods before. (I live deep in the High Peaks of the Adirondacks, so I am no stranger to backcountry sounds.) It sounded like a man sort of yelling but it had a deep, animal-like quality to it. I asked my brothers if they had heard the sound, but they said that they hadnt. In fact, I believe that they thought I was joking. After a few more minutes of snapping pictures, glassing the slope and waiting around to see if whatever had made that sound was going to make it again (it didnt) we piled back into the Jeep and continued up the mountain.We followed this road all the way to the trailhead (one of our two options for tomorrows hike) without incident.Coming back down the mountain, we now turned left onto another forest service road to reconnoiter the second trailhead. Conditions immediately went from raw to terrible. This forest service road is unpaved and the cold rain now changed to snow the higher we climbed. (Our elevation at this point was somewhere between 3,500-4,000 feet.) There had obviously been snow at some earlier point because the road had roughly an inch to an inch and a half of old snow scattered on it and piled up on the sides in patches. My brother suggested that we might want to get out of the Jeep and scan the side of the road in order to see if we could come upon any kind of tracks. We were not thinking Bigfoot at this point, we were just trying to get an idea of what kind of animals we might be encountering in the next few days. Almost immediately, we found some large and clear bear tracks. These were good-sized tracks and I would guesstimate that they were from some 300-500 lb. animal. (Again, I live in the Adirondacks and we are well stocked with bears.)I mention these tracks because as we were following them up the hill we came across a very different set of tracks.At approximately 4:45 pm we encountered a second set of tracks crossing the road. These tracks were moving perpendicular to the bear tracks we had been following and were clearly NOT bear tracks. The first track was approximately 17-18 inches long and 6 inches in width. It looked exactly like a naked human footprint, but there was little visible arch. In other words, it was rather filled in where you would expect the arch indentation to be. The print appeared to be from a right foot and a clearly defined big toe was visible. It also seemed as if the bear we had been following had stepped directly into this track but it in no way obscured what we were looking at. These two types of tracks were directly before us so that I can say, as far as comparisons between the two, this new set of tracks had come from some completely different animal.Following the track, a 2nd track was discernable roughly 4 to 4 ½ feet from the first track across the road. This track was much more degraded than the first track but appeared to be from a left foot of consistent dimensions with the first. The conditions wouldnt allow for any casting and, besides, we had left nearly all of our equipment back at the hotel. This was supposed to have been an in-and-out scouting run and, consequently, we were poorly prepared to document any findings. The spotty snow and the lay of the land discouraged our finding any more tracks and so, snapping too few pictures, we continued up the mountain to the junction near the lake.I must add, at this point, that our finding of these tracks in no way involved any skill on our parts. This was an instance of pure DUMB LUCK. If we had arrived any later, the quickly deteriorating weather conditions would have destroyed these tracks without our ever having found them. We were extremely lucky to have come across them when we did. It must also be noted that there were no signs of anyone else having come into that area before us. The only tire tracks in the mud and the snow on that road had come from our Jeep. Until we had gotten there, everything seemed to have been completely undisturbed.Further up, the road splits with the right fork heading toward a camp and the way ahead leading toward a lake. To our left was an animal corral and a short road leading to a dead end in a gravel excavation. These details would be important later but, for the moment, we decided to try forging up the road toward the lake. The way soon became impassable with snow and, having gotten the Jeep stuck a number of times, we turned back to begin our return to Yreka.Returning down the FS road we were approaching the overlook/turnout where I had heard the strange, AHHHHH! We were discussing this sound when we decided to enter the turnout again, being much more focused and alert this time, to see if it would repeat itself. At 5:35 pm, we put the windows down, turned the Jeep off and coasted into the turnout. Almost immediately the same prolonged, AHHHHH, came from the same direction from which I had heard it the first time. My brother in the front seat said, I heard that!, and we all got out of the Jeep. It was deathly quiet after we had gotten out, but two of us had definitely heard the sound this time as we had entered the turnout.After waiting a few minutes for a repetition of the noise and getting nothing but silence in return, my first brother asked my second brother to Whoop at the hill which the sound had seemed to come from. I was returning to the Jeep when my second brother let out a bone jarring, Whoop! (a skill he apparently learned on two previous, official BFRO expeditions.) I did not hear it, probably due to my position in the Jeep, but my first brother said that within several seconds of my second brothers having Whooped, 5-6 hard wood knocks suddenly came from the same hillside where he and I had heard the strange vocalization. We are all very clear on what happened next.We were all out of the Jeep now, straining to hear if we could catch any more wood knocks when a blood-curdling scream suddenly came from our 2 oclock. It was a very high-pitched, prolonged, almost feminine sounding scream that seemed to be coming from a fairly good distance away. (I dont want to speculate on exactly how far.) The scream did not in any way sound like any type of big cat or some kind of bird. It sounded like a loud, human scream.It was startling and more than a little unnerving.My second brother gave another loud, Whoop, but we got no further responses. After the scream, the woods remained quiet.With absolutely nothing happening, being a little rattled and with evening closing in, we got back into the Jeep and drove to Yreka for the night.May 11th, weather conditions were beautiful as we drove into the camp trailhead early in the morning to begin our hike into the valley. Temperatures were expected to be near the 70s and the sky was bright and clear. We thought that we would be able to hike the roughly 7 and a half miles into the valley in about 5 hours.60 lb packs and much more snow than we had anticipated quickly put an end to that idea.We decided to retreat to our fallback position and attempt an entry from near the lake. We knew from the night before that road directly to the trailhead soon became impassable for the Jeep a short distance beyond the camp junction, but it appeared from our map that it would be a relatively short hike in to the trailhead from where we would have to ditch our vehicle. While we had encountered snow up from the junction, we hoped that it was just a bad patch and that the snow would break and the hiking would be easier once we got through that particular area.Again, that proved not to be the case.Stuck now and wondering just how we were going to get into the valley, we realized that we were going to have to make a choice. We could either scrap our idea of getting into the valley from these approaches, take the long drive into Eureka and attempt an entry by going up a creek, or make camp somewhere in the immediate area and attempt a dash into the lake area with extremely stripped down daypacks.Hating the idea of another long car ride and of wasting another day without getting into the woods, we opted to find a spot close to the camp / lake junction.Driving the Jeep up the dead end road, past the animal corral, we set up camp in the old gravel pit. Our camp was situated in a flat, roughly 50 yard in diameter hollow, ringed by rough mounds of rock and gravel. Our GPS indicated that our base camp was sitting at 4,862 feet. Aside from having to hike a short distance downhill for water, our camp offered us a relatively protected haven on the mountaintop.I want to make our situation clear in light of subsequent events. We did not intend to be where we were. We were forced to make last minute decisions if we were going to try and stay with our original plans of getting into this specific valley. Our position wasnt ideal, but it did provide us with a moderate degree of comfort and a footing for making a dash into the desired area. We settled into our camp and the rest of the day passed uneventfully.After a dinner of some MREs, we passed a very quiet and bitterly cold night.The morning of May 12th couldnt come too soon.The night before had been almost too much for the gear (20 degree bags and a couple of three season tents) we had with us. I woke up at about 6:30 to winter cold and an icy tent. My second brother was already up while my first brother appeared to have retreated to the Jeep sometime during the night. He had gotten his feet wet before climbing into his bag and had been forced to use the heater in the Jeep to stop his feet from freezing.We decided to leave him in the Jeep and let him sleep.At around 8am, my second brother and I decided to gather some snow to make coffee.As the gravel pit was entirely snow free, we had to walk down past what we had nicknamed the OK Corral to the junction, where there was still plenty of snow. Off to our left, a couple of hundred feet down a very steep decline from our camp, we could hear the fairly loud rushing water of a creek. As neither of us relished the idea of trying to work down that decline and then struggle back up just to get some water, we were going to make do with the snow at hand.We were just beginning to gather some snow when we suddenly heard the sound of rocks being banged together in the creek bed below us. It was very clear and very distinct. The rocks were being banged together in series of threes. Bang-Bang-Bang. There were always three bangs with equal intervals between strikes. To me, these bangs sounded entirely deliberate. After the first three bangs, I said to my brother, Did you hear that? He was replying that he had when the rocks banged again. Thankfully, I had brought a Handy Cam with us and I now started shooting. My brother decided to try another of his Whoops to see if we could get any response from whatever was banging rocks together in the creek. He let out his Whoop and after 5 seconds we suddenly heard four loud bangs from down in the creek bed. Again, these were very loud bangs and they were clearly being made by whatever was down in the creek smashing stones together.This last series of four bangs were clearly picked up by the Handy Cam.After the last series of bangs, there were no more sounds from down in the creek.Excited and a little flustered, we rushed back to the camp to wake up our brother in the Jeep. After getting him up, we told him what had happened when we had gone to gather snow. He was excited, but said that he had been sleeping and that he hadnt heard a thing.A Zoom H2 that wed had running at the time may have picked up the banging in the creek but hasnt been properly reviewed as of this writing.At roughly 9am, my second brother and I were sitting around drinking coffee and getting things ready for our attempted dash into the lake area. My first brother was walking toward the steep slope on the edge of our camp that lead down into the creek when suddenly a very loud, canine bark startled all of us. The bark sounded like a large dogs, Woof. The sound had come from close below us, somewhere back in the direction of the OK Corral. We all looked up and I fully expected to see a big dog come running into camp being followed by a ranger.No such dog or ranger appeared.In fact, we looked everywhere to find the animal that had made that sound but nothing was moving on that mountain. I have heard deer and elk bark and this deep woof was nothing like that. It sounded exactly like the biggest dog in any suburban neighborhood. While that sound wouldnt seem out of place back in civilization, it seemed entirely out of place and strange in our isolated setting.It was so out of place that we all noted it.Unfortunately, I had already packed up the Zoom for our hike and completely missed catching the sound.Cleaning up and shouldering our packs, we struck out for the lake.We started walking up the forest service road, making for the trailhead. From the trailhead, it would be what we had read was a comparatively easy, little over a mile hike in to the lake. From this lake, we would be within striking distance of a second lake, which figured into two sightings reports from last year (2009).It seemed pretty straightforward.It wasnt.As the road rose up from the junction, the snow got worse. We would go through large patches that would come almost to our knees only to break through to long stretches of bare earth. It was slow going, but doable. If we had known that we would encountering so much snow, we would have been better prepared with snowshoes, poles and full winter gear. As it was, we were going through terrain in conditions we probably had no business to be attempting with woefully inadequate gear.No one said we were smart.About three miles in, we encountered a cinnamon bear. Off to our right, coming up quite a steep slope through a section of burn-out, a small to medium (about 200 lb) bear was lumbering towards us. The bear was about 30 yards away and, at first, didnt see us. We stopped and, not relishing the thought of a closer encounter, we caught the bears attention and began to identify ourselves. The bear stopped and a tense five-minute stare down began. The bear seemed to be standing its ground and didnt particularly appear to want to back down. We yelled and tried to make ourselves look bigger, but none of this seemed to impress the bear. I make these points because before me, at relatively close range, I was able to observe a native bear in the wild and to see how this bear would move through these woods. This becomes important later.After yelling and waving for what felt like a long time, a can of Counter Assault was produced and we got ready for the bear. Suddenly my first brother, having had enough of this war of wills, shouted an expletive and began throwing rocks at the bear. This did the trick and the bear took off at a run back down the slope.I say this again to emphasize that I had before me a living example of how a bear looked running through those woods.We continued trekking into the trailhead, coming across deeper and deeper patches of snow, until we finally reached the true start of our hike at about 2 oclock. Post holing now into snow at times up to our thighs and waists, it became pretty clear that the inner valley was effectively sealed off. Even though the temperature was in the low 70s and it was a bright, sunny day, the conditions were just too much.We decided to make some lunch and then begin the hike back to base camp. We made a small fire and had some MREs.It was after 2:45pm when we started our return to base camp and the going wasnt any easier on the way back. Later, my first brother confessed that he had begun to feel uneasy at the snowed-in trailhead. He had said nothing to me at the time, but he later told me that he had confessed to our second brother that he felt like we were being watched from the moment wed gotten there.  Much later, after wed returned home, he said that, at points, while we had been working our way back down the FS Road from the lake, he had had the strangest sensations. He said that he could feel a prickly feeling along his scalp and that he could literally feel the hair standing up on the back of his neck. He said that hed never felt anything quite like this before and that it happened twice on our return trip. Subsequently, he began lingering behind my second brother and I and videoing longer stretches of the return hike.Neither my second brother nor I experienced this uncomfortable feeling of being under observation.Things continued like this until a point approximately 2 miles from the camp /  lake junction on the FS Road.At approximately 4pm, I was actually bringing up the rear. We were a little tired by this point and we had grown quite loud, laughing and talking. I was raising my hand in a sweeping gesture to finally point at the ridiculously steep grade of the ridge on our right which we were in the process of traversing. As I raised my hand, pointing and making some stupid joke, something suddenly moved on the slope in front of me. From about 30 yards up the slope, something suddenly darted out from behind a tree and ran up the slope to a second group of trees. My first impression was the size of the object. It was big, at least 6 to 6.5 feet tall. My second brother is 62 and it was just about his size, if not a little bit bigger. It was bulky and muscular, and I immediately thought of a jacked-up football player. I could only see it from the waist up, due to foliage on the slope, but what I could clearly see was an upright muscular form running for the trees. I will elaborate more on this figure in a moment.My second impression was the speed at which the figure was moving. Whatever it was, it was moving over impossible terrain at a FRIGHTENING speed. I immediately thought that nothing that big should be able to move that fast. It was moving from left to right from one tree up a very steep angle of ascent (I guesstimate a 60 degree incline) at an angle to a second V-shaped group of two trees. It covered 10-15 yards in no time, moving over ground that we would have had to have climbed almost on our hands and knees. Once it reached that second group of trees, it was gone. I do not know what it did or where it went after it reached those trees. I also noticed that, whatever this was, it did not bob as it ran. It looked almost as if the figure were gliding up the slope on a track. I can say with utmost certainty, IT DID NOT MOVE LIKE A BEAR. This upright figure was nothing like the bear we had seen earlier. Whatever this was, it was unique and I have never, before or since, seen anything like it.My last impression was of its color. The figure appeared to be covered with a uniform coat of hair that was 2-3 inches in length. This hair was primarily of a coyote or burnt sienna color but there was also a lot of grey mixed in. Its fur looked almost brindled, meaning that there was almost as much grey as brown. If it hadnt of moved, I never would have seen it. Standing still, the animal blended perfectly into its background.All of this transpired in the seconds it took this animal to travel the 10-15 yards between the trees.Looking back on the figure I had seen, I can say that its form was basically that of an upright human, but there were definitely some gorilla-like characteristics as well. I saw the animal primarily from the side with a great deal of back and shoulders being presented, as if it were turning away from me. It ran with its right arm folded across its face and seemed to be looking over the top of its arm as it moved. I could see no features because of this arm covering its face, but a conical head and the edge of what appeared to be a crest were visible. The animal displayed a pronounced musculature, and I was particularly struck by the sheer size of the bicep, its back and the massive traps. Like a gorilla, I could see no neck. As already stated, the foliage obscured the rest of the animal.I immediately shouted something like, Over there!, but by that time it was too late and whatever it was was gone.  I cannot stress enough to any one who has never seen an animal like this how profoundly disturbing the speed at which this animal is capable of moving is. I had been holding a Handy Cam on standby and ready to go and I was never able to get off a shot. I believe this is exactly why more of these animals havent been filmed: they just move too fast.  All I could do was stand there pointing with my mouth hanging open.My brothers asked me what was going on and I tried to tell them. I know that they did not believe me at first. I kept insisting that Id just seen a Bigfoot run up the side of the mountain and, gradually, they started to realize that I wasnt joking. We stood there for a few minutes, gawking and staring up the side of the mountain into the trees, but there were absolutely no sounds or movement coming from the direction in which the creature had gone. My second brother went so far as to try using some samurai  chatter in hopes of eliciting some response from the animal if it were hiding close by, but there was no response. After about 10 minutes of nothing, we decided to continue on our way back to camp.I know that this was a decision that will frustrate many people who might read this report and it deserves a word of explanation. On my part, the thought of climbing up that slope to search for prints, hair, or possibly even another look at the animal did not even enter my mind. I must stress that the thought was never there to be dismissed. It was inconceivable. Now, I equate it to sitting in a small boat fishing when, suddenly, something large and unknown cruises under your boat. You do not think of jumping into the water to see what that large thing was. This is not fear. From my brief experience, all I can say is that you do not naturally want to move closer to one of these animals. The reason is as simple as that.Ironically, although my brothers hadnt seen the animal, they didnt discuss going up that slope either. It just didnt feel right.From that point on, although we were all keyed-up and anxiously waiting for something else to happen, we returned to base camp without further incident.It was now sometime after 5pm and we had some decisions to make. Basically, we debated whether or not we should stay or, in light of that days activity, pull out.We opted to break camp and spend the night in Willow Creek.This decision also deserves a word of explanation. Our first consideration was the extremely difficult weather conditions that we had been enduring from the start of the expedition. We had been in snow and facing below freezing conditions that we had not been prepared for. The thought of another icy night in the tents or, worse, all of us crammed into the Jeep trying to stay warm were hard trials to think about. While the daytime temperatures were mild and pleasant, the nighttime almost 5,000 feet up in a gravel pit on the top of a mountain was brutal. In this regard, we were not being smart. Our second consideration was the thought of the animal we had just encountered, both directly and indirectly, paying us a visit in the darkness. While my brothers were game for such an encounter, I most definitely was not. This was not coming from fear on my part; I will argue that it was just good common sense. It was definitely going to take me some time to adjust to what I had just seen. In the end, my brothers gave in to my desire to pullout. I am grateful to them.I still dont regret our decision.Feeling pretty damn happy with everything wed accomplished already, we ended this leg of our expedition.Having had some time now to mentally digest what had happened during our short stay in these mountains, my brothers and I have put together some ideas concerning the activity we observed:1. We definitely feel that whatever was making those AHHHHH! calls on our first day was acting as some sort of sentry or lookout. Whatever was watching the road only called out when we came into view and its position allowed it an excellent opportunity to monitor all possible human traffic into and out of those valley access points. (We did not hear it during our final departure from the mountains but it was getting quite late by then.)2. Based on the fact that something screamed from a second position in seeming response to the first callers woodknocks, there was definitely more than one of the creatures in the area.3. Based on my brothers intuitions, my sighting, and a subsequent development, we feel that we picked up something at the snowed-in trailhead and that this something was trailing us from higher up on the side of the mountain during our return hike to base camp.4. I believe that my sweeping/pointing gesture caused the animal to believe that it had been observed and that this caused it to break and run for new cover. This is the only reason we even knew the animal was there.I also would like to add a final observation concerning the creature I observed. One of the names the Native Americans of Northern California have for this creature is Tintah-kiwungxoyan, which translates into something like Boss of the Mountain. I can think of no better name for the animal I saw. This animal seems perfectly suited for its environment. It can blend into and move through its terrain at will. Its size suggests a lot of power and its speed is startling. It outclasses us in the backcountry in every possible way. This animal could have, if it had wanted to, taken us at any time and there would have been very little we could have done about it. It definitely deserves our respect and protection.I would also like to add two postscripts to this report:1. On May 13th,  we stopped by the China-Flat Museum to see the Bigfoot wing. While we were there, we were talking to Peggy McWilliams from the museum about what wed experienced during our short stay in those mountains. After some interesting comments on her own part about those caves near the rim, she called our attention to a gentlemen who was just entering the museum. This gentleman turned out to be Al Hodgson. After some brief small talk, we told Mr. Hodgson about our recent experiences. He was quite interested and, at several points during our story, actually made the comment, That sounds about right. We showed him the pictures of the tracks and these also seemed to intrigue him. When all was said and done, he very kindly asked us for our names and our contact numbers. As he was leaving, he turned to me with a smile and said, In forty years, Ive never seen one. He was a  gentleman from beginning to end, fascinating to talk to and a genuine pleasure to have met.2. On May 25th, my second brother was reviewing the footage from his video camera. We had been shooting with two cameras and we had well over 12 hours of footage to go over. While reviewing footage we had shot on May 12th, he came to a portion that he had filmed after our return to base camp from our hike back from the lake trailhead. This footage was shot just as we reentered camp and were facing back toward the mountain and the junction. While it will never convince the skeptical, the video shows something large moving through the trees until it comes to a small clump. The object ducks down and then what appears to be a head pokes out on one side, facing in the direction of our camp. The shot ends after about 40 seconds. None of us had any idea at the time that the figure was there.Its an intriguing end to a very intriguing experience. I am extremely happy to have some evidence to support my sighting. In retrospect, I am even more glad now that we didnt attempt climbing up that slope after the running figure. This video seems to suggest that whatever it was, it never moved after it hid behind those trees. If we had climbed that slope, I now believe that the animal I had seen would have been waiting there. In all likelihood it would have run again, but I really would hate to think about having an up-close, face-to-face encounter with whatever was on that mountain. In addition, in light of the fact that this video was shot almost 2 miles further down the FS Road from where I had initially seen the creature, I now believe that this animal waited for us to move and then continued tracking us all the way back to our camp.While I dont in any way feel that we were in serious danger from this creature, I feel even better now about having spent that last night in Willow Creek. "
28730,"December coon hunt on Fewtown Road on the dog training grounds me and 3 buddys lost our dogs. The Garmin GPS wasn't working so we couldnt track them, we waited for one of them to strike and heard our dogs strike a long ways away. Fewtown road is located in Atwater. We drove all the way to the other side of the hunting ground and walked into the woods about 400 yards. One dog ran to our feet with its tail tucked. These are coon dogs, they don't run from their quarry. This dog would not leave our side. We had one dog 70 yards away where he was treein a coon. He stopped strike [editor's note: hunting dogs wear strike collars that indicate to the hunter electronically when the dog has stopped moving] this is is when we heard the loudest groaning wailing call. We all stood there mouths dropped. We put the one dog on a lead and my buddy went to get his dog so we could leave I went with him to get his dog. The dog stood pointed the opposite way of the tree with is hair on his back standing straight up, then we heard the loud long wailing noise again. We were all scared by then and didn't feel like investigating the call. No other cars were there nor were there any hunters there. No other dogs and there are no bears in the area. "
32976,"I have three encounters with what I believe to be Bigfoot or an unknown crpytid. 2008-In late fall I accompanied my wife, daughter, and my mother to stay in a rental cabin near island lake, situated near the manistee national forest in northern lower michigan.  As an avid mountain biker I brought along my bike and had planned several rides. The second day of my stay I set off on a ride about 6pm and entered a thick pine/cedar forest on what appeared to be a game trail. After roughly 1.5 miles of riding (I marked a way point on my GPS before entering the woods so I could easily find my way back) I noticed my front tire was very low on air. Shortly after I came to a very small clearing in the woods, it was clear cut purposefully with exposed stumps and new undergrowth. I set my bike against a pine stump and began to repair my front tire. To my right roughly 50-60 yards was a partially destroyed and burnt old RV. Seconds after glancing at it, a very loud thump came from within the camper. All I can describe it is as a ""head"" appeared in a broken window, which had to be over six feet from the base of the camper. From my distance all I could see was jet black fur and no noticeable ears, the eyes were not noticeable or black as well. It cocked its head to the right slightly as I mounted my mountain bike. I rode off quickly following my GPS map back to my starting point. Whatever it was I saw I believe followed me back to my cabin, as very foul and pungent odor lingered outside the next morning. 2009For a short time while finishing my bachelors degree my wife and daughter lived with my dad. His house was at the end of a very long drive which backed up to hundreds of acres of woods and a large state recreation area called Waterloo in southern lower Michigan. After my parents divorced my mom who is a nurse moved in with her mother to provide care who lived right next door. December 3 I arrived home from school about 7pm. Shortly thereafter (I lived in an apartment in the basement) I hear a knock on the sliding glass door. It was my mother who looked very disturbed and frightened, and says she has been hearing howls all evening. I assumed coyotes as they were very abundant there. She was unshakeable in her opinion that it was not a coyote. I stepped outside onto the patio and shut off the exterior light. What I did notice immediately was a very strong odor being whirled around in the wind. I waited nearly 5 minutes and then I heard it, it was very near the tree line. Howling like I never have heard from a coyote, deep penetrating bass notes that sounded ragged and throaty. It was very windy and beginning to snow, and the howls seemed to occur in different locations. Due to the snow falling overnight no tracks or signs were observed.Thank you for reading my encounters, I appreciate your time. "
33256,"While on a training exercise in Ft. Pickett, VA., I was positioned in an observation point overlooking a camp. I was lying low in our hide providing over watch while my team member attempted to move in to within approximately 75 yards of this camp. It was at this point when three distinct knocking sounds spread no more than 1 second apart, were heard from our 6 oclock position. The distance appeared to be within 100 yards. After a very short pause of about three, maybe five seconds, there was the sound of a large branch or small tree breaking in half. The noise was so loud that everyone in the camp grabbed their flashlights and searched the tree line towards the direction of the sound. We were almost compromised by this noise, but as quickly as the sounds were heard, the forest fell silent. Unfortunately, no one was able to further investigate those sounds due to our focus being the exercise and not the wild life. Approximately two, maybe three hours later, one of the cadre was listening to a range radio and overheard a conversation between an adjacent range and range control. The conversation spanned only a few minutes, but in summary it went like this: Range Control, this is range #... umm, there is a Bigfoot walking across the range! This range was only a few kilometers from our location.Early the next morning, maybe 5am, one of the members of our team had to depart the training environment so he was given a coordinate to meet for ex-filtration. He arrived early and waited until the extraction team arrived. During his time alone, he commented that he heard loud foot steps behind him. He was not sure if it was a large deer coming to investigate or what, but he said it came very close to him. So close that he was hearing this animal breathing behind him only a little ways off. He said he felt uneasy and didnt dare turn around because his initial thought was that it might just be a buck that would become startled and attack him. A few moments later, the animal departed and shortly after he was extracted. He didnt want to think of this animal as anything but perhaps a deer. After the exercise, we spoke with the role players about that night. They all heard the sound and thought one of us was trying to play a game with them or that one of us had fallen down the side of an embankment causing the loud noise. Once we advised them that it was not us, they just went silent and didnt speak of it any further. The strange thing is that earlier that night I had this eerie feeling, like something was watching me from behind. My reaction at the time was to grasp my knife and prepare for whatever may come next. It never reached that point, but my senses were heightened and I found myself scanning my surroundings more often with my night vision. Due to the nature of my work, I cannot go into great detail as to the exact month or day, but I can mention that it was in the early months leading up to spring. But I cannot deny that there is something other than normal wild life in the woods surrounding Ft. Pickett, VA. "
34426,"I was out hiking one morning on a popular local trail when I decided to explore the area around it using my GPS. It is an open hammock containing old growth liveoaks with a lot of surrounding history from the sugarmill period all the way back to the first native americans that inhabited the area thousands of years ago. I was ""off trail"" approximately several hundred yards when I came upon an un-natural looking intertwined tree formation capped off with a dead ""y"" shaped branch weaved in the top. I tried to think of how this could have occurred naturally but it simply could not have. I marked the site and took pictures and basically forgot about it until I read a report of an encounter in the same area by some local fishermen. I now wonder if it is a navigation or territory marker of some kind. "

35789,"At the time of this occurrence we had been at Clarkco State Park for two nights in a cabin.  The previous morning, Wednesday, October 20, 2010, I had walked the length of the cabin road to its dead end, turned around, and then walked the length of the cabin road all the way across the dam to the park headquarters building.   During this time I shot photos of leaf colors, a duck on the water, and various other things.  Nothing unusual was seen or heard that morning (morning of Wednesday, October 20, 2010).The following morning (Thursday, October 21, 2010) I awoke around 730AM.  My wife was still asleep.    I had a bite to eat, put on my clothes, got my digital camera, and headed out on the road towards the dam of Clarkco Lake to get some early morning photos.  The time I left the cabin was about 815AM CDT.The temp was down around 45 degrees that morning and there was a light fog coming off the lake.  The morning was completely clear  brilliant sunshine - with no overcast and some light breezes now and then.  I tried to sneak up on some turtles that were out on a log to shoot a photo, but they were too quick for me.   All of them slipped into the water.  I shot a few photos of the lake, leaf colors, and the fog from the south end of the dam (the end away from the park headquarters building).   After shooting several photos I headed back to the cabin on the road that led away from the dam.   When I was about 150 feet from our cabin I heard a distinct knocking sound like you would get if you were hitting a 2x4 with another 2x4, or maybe hitting a 2x4 with a hammer.   I thought there might be some carpenters doing some work at a house located nearby.   However, we were inside the state park and I knew of no houses  other than the ranger houses - within the park.    This knocking sound continued on.   I didn't count the number of ""knocks,"" but I'd say they numbered at least ten knocks and were in a steady rhythm.I stopped walking and looked directly into the wooded, hilly area in the direction the sound seemed to be coming from (towards the south).   The knocking stopped when I stopped walking.   I saw nothing and heard nothing while I was stopped on the road.   There were no odors in the air at this time either.   As mentioned above, there was a light breeze blowing from time to time that morning. I then proceeded to walk to our cabin which was only about another 75 feet away.   As I began to walk the knocking sound started again and this time I attempted to count the knocks.   There were five or six knocks in a steady rhythm.  Then there were no more.    When I got into the driveway of the cabin I again looked in the direction that I thought the sounds came from and saw nothing.      Could this sound have come from construction work between the state park and U.S. Highway 45?   Could there have been a utility company crew working in the woods on a power line? I have been in the woods for years as a Scout leader, a camper, and as a hunter, I have heard woodpeckers and other animals make noises before.   This was not a woodpecker.   It was not a deer hitting a tree with his rack.   This was a heavy and deliberate sound.  This knocking sound was unlike any animal sound I have ever encountered.    There were no ""whoops,"" ""calls,"" or other noises, just the wood knocking sound.   The knocking was a ""hard"" sound almost like a carpenter hitting a piece of wood repeatedly with a hammer in a steady rhythm.   That's one of the reasons I lean towards it being a sound from a construction site.    However, the fact that the knocking stopped when I stopped walking and looked into the woods, and then resumed when I began walking again, makes me think there are other possibilities as to its origin.After coming home from the state park I listened to wood knocking sounds on the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization website.   The wood knocking sound I heard exactly matches the recorded wood knocking sounds on some of the bigfoot websites.  Again, the sound was similar to hitting two 2x4s together or pounding on a 2x4 with a hammer.During midmorning of that same day we left the state park and went to Meridian for a few hours.    My wife was not feeling well when we returned, so when we got back to the state park we packed our belongings in the car and headed for home.   We had paid for three nights at the park, but we only stayed two nights.  We left the park around 330PM CDT that day.   I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary the remainder of the time we were in the state park.The GPS coordinates where I was on the cabin road when I heard these knocking sounds are approximately:     N  32 degrees, 5 minutes, 53 seconds     W  88 degrees, 41 minutes, 44 seconds. "
36514,"I took my son Myles fishing behind Sundown Mountain ski resort. We turned west off of Asbury road on to Twin Springs Drive, where there is access to the stream. I had been promising my son some night fishing. We sat on a couple of buckets facing south, to the rock out cropping and wooded area across the creek. We were fishing in the deeper water across the creek near the rocks. We heard sticks breaking and rustling which I assumed were coons, as this is a good coon area. Then we noticed something larger coming toward the other side of the creek from a distance. Thinking that this is one of many deer that we often see, thought nothing of it until we caught sight of it in the back-light of the city or moon from the other side of the hill we were facing. This was a large bipedal animal, very unlikely to be a person, this time of night without a light (although we were fishing without a light source also). It came up to the top of the rock out cropping direct across from us and stood between two trees. It then squatted down and just sat there watching us. My son was scared, and I was intrigued. Within 10 minutes another came to join the first to his right and stayed just across a ravine. No more than 6 minutes later another came from the south, just to the left of the one squatting across from us. As this one got close, it let out a piercing shriek. Nothing like the calls that are heard on the TV shows. This was high pitched and frightening. The other two took notice and began to move toward the shrieking Squatch. At this point we had had enough and grabbed our fishing gear and ran back to the truck. The GPS location is as follows: 42.514765,-90.842826 "

39831,"I was photographing the sunrise on Sat 4th February in the morning on the frozen shore of Big Spirit Lake in northern Iowa, it was about 5am, so I had to wait until daylight. I shut off my vehicle, walked out towards the lake and stopped to listen to the ice cracking on the lake. To the North of me I heard three very distinct sounds that I would say we're 'wood knocks', I am reluctant to say that because I don't want to pigeon hole what I heard, I would estimate the distance of the noise to have been within 1/4 mile or so. In response to that I heard from the South at a closer distance the sound of, and I can only describe it as bottles being moved in a trash can. The temp was 4 deg and there were no other vehicles in the area, it is a state campground, but obviously shut for the winter. I saw no ice fishermen in the area until about 6am or later. It was as if the 'whatever it was' to the South was being alerted to my presence by a lookout. I would not consider the area to be highly wooded, but there is an abundance of deer and they obviously hide well in the area. I left pretty spooked cursing the fact I had an slr camera with video capabilities, but being totally alone freaked me out. Have you heard of any Sasquatch reports in the area at all, I can give an exact GPS coordinate or map reference if needed. North west side of Big Spirit Lake, IA, near Okoboji, and Spirit Lake, thanks [name removed by investigator] "
40645," If you are going toward Hopewell from Petersburg on 36 there is a circular ""subdivision"" across from the gates on the left.  At the time, the basketball courts are on the northwest side and the trail into the woods runs northeast kind of parallel to 36.  The stream starts at the subdivision and runs through the woods below the earthen walls toward the northwest.  I could provide you GPS coordinates if that helped.  I can still see the area on google maps though I now live in Florida"
45726,"June 22, 2014While on a dirt bike riding trip with three friends we came to an intersection of two dirt roads about 7 miles north of Plain, WA.  As soon as we stopped and turned off the motorcycles we heard what sounded like someone hitting a tree with a stick.  We initially didn't think much of it as we were not familiar with the immediate area and assumed that there were people near by.  Two of us walked closer to the intersection to see if there were other motorcycles or vehicles parked down the road. We found none.  After several minutes, hearing no other sounds, I picked up a stick and hit a tree two times.  Within three seconds we heard two or three very loud tree knocks.  At this time we got on our motorcycles and left the area immediately.  The next day two of us returned to the same location to see if we could find a trail or a campsite in the area where we heard the knocking. The forest was thick and there were no signs of any trails or camping sites .  I have the exact location marked on my cell phone gps. I have the exact loacation marked on my cell phone gps and am more than happy to show it."
47107,"This witness sent in two reports, the reports have been combined. (Investigator)First report: Growl/howl heard today 16 Nov 2014 while hunting outside Winlock Washington at 2:42pm. While hunting, I heard yelling mixed with a growl/scream within 200 yards of my hunting location. This is the same area three of us heard the same thing in November 2012.This time, within minutes, I was upwind from the screams, then I recorded the sound of trees breaking and the sound of foot steps ""Pounding"" the ground. It got closer then I got the Heck out of there. What few deer I did see, RAN fast away as soon as the screams began.I have a long history in investigations, and know EXACTLY what I heard, minute by minute. I will take a group of your investigators out to the exact location, and show you the location on a GPS map.PLEASE contact me!! This was too much.Second report:Sent  a report on 16 Nov 2014 about a encounter while hunting outside Winlock Wa. Went back out to look for physical evidence of my first encounter. What happened next spooked me very bad, making me somewhat sick to my stomach. As I follow a wide trail into the thick tree growth, I heard noise to my right, some distance below me. I stopped, listened, and began to pull my digital recorder out while holding my digital video camera. I never got the chance to turn on either. Within seconds, to my right I watched the top of the pine trees (15-20 feet tall) shake violently. Followed by the loudest, harshest scream I NEVER want to hear EVER again.Only other thing I saw were suspicious tree breaks, unknown if human made although, there in a untraveled area of the forest on the perimeter of the clear cut. "
47536,"On approximately April 22,14 I was at Fools Hollow Lake near Showlow, AZ I was out on the lake around the bend fishing where a storm was starting to roll in from the east as the storm was getting closer I was becoming more uncomfortable so I decided to start heading in. I was heading west when I spotted what I thought was a bear down on all four drinking water from the edge of the lake my approximate coordinates were 34.277763, -110.071018 and when I first spotted the creature its coordinates were 34.277126, -110.072090 off the point at the bend of the lake (the lake is a sideways ""L"" shape. As I got closer to the creature still thinking it was a large black bear I saw it stand up on its two hind legs and look towards me. The creature then turned and walked into the wooded area behind it where I lost sight of it. The small time frame in which I did see the creature walking depicted very similarly to the Patterson video this creature about 7-8' tall longer arm length reaching towards its mid thigh and walking with a very long stride and a hunch. The creature appeared to have a reddish brown color to it a few shades darker than an orangutan. After losing sight of the creature I was unable to catch it in my sight again. With the storm right behind me and lightning all around I did not want to be on the lake in a 12' aluminum boat so I headed back to shore. "

51800,"I have been hunting Green Swamp since the late 70s. Though I tend to hunt more than one Wildlife Management Area each year the Green Swamp WMA is a go-to area for me. I have spent possibly a thousand days in the Green Swamp over the last 35 years. I am very familiar with terrain and all of the plants, insects, and wildlife in the area. I have a demanding job that makes it difficult to coordinate a hunt with friends, so for the last 30 or so years I have hunted alone. I have walked in and out of different hunt locations in the dark hundreds of times and have never seen or heard anything that alarmed me. In about 2010 a new tract of land was added and opened to hunters in Green Swamp. The tract is about 1000 acres of planted pines that are about 15 years old, trunks about 10 inches in diameter, and clear of branches up to about 7 feet. The planted pines are about 15 feet apart and are planted in rows, each row is also about 15 feet apart. There is a heavy layer of pine straw so very little low vegetation is present. It is possible to see for hundreds of yards down each row, but visibility to each side across the rows is limited to about 50 yards. The pines are planted between natural cypress swamps, and a few small ponds. Access is limited to foot traffic only and there is only one way in and one way out. Hunting this area requires a lot of walking. I will often take a vacation in January and hunt for the better part of the week in the Green Swamp before the season closes. After the Christmas holidays the woods are quiet with few if any hunters. During the week it is not uncommon for there to be fewer than 10 hunters in the entire 55,000 acre WMA.In mid January of 2012 I had taken a vacation to hunt this area. This was my second year hunting the new area. It was mid week, there were no other vehicles parked at the entrance to this area, the weather was cool and clear. I was using a large garden cart of the type sold at Tractor Supply to haul in a heavy climbing treestand, that would also be used to haul out a deer or hog if required. I had hunted the edge of a swamp that morning and at mid day I decided to take down my stand and move to another location. I loaded up my cart and was pulling it along, rifle in hand, down one of the long rows of pines. I got to a location that the visibility down the row looking due west was exceptional, so I took a break, but was still actively hunting game that might cross this row. I set my backpack as a rifle rest and lay prone, my line of fire was west down the row. I am in full camo, with no face covering. My garden cart is an unnatural bright green with silver painted wheels, with treestand on top, probably about 40 inches in height overall. It was between 2pm and 3pm, bright but indirect sunlight through the young pines. I had been there for a few minutes and had been checking for work e-mails on my phone, when I caught motion to my left. I looked up and there were 3 big dudes in black ghille suits no more than 10 yards away from me walking in single file quartering away crossing my line of fire. I laid there surprised but motionless and let them pass. They walked in a NNW direction for about 50 or 60 yards into a cypress swamp, before I lost sight of them. Shortly after they walked out of sight they started banging around in the swamp, loudly. The banging sounded almost metallic, a dull donk like hollow aluminum against a tree. I thought these idiots were very loudly and carelessly taking their tree stands down. There were possibly 20 bangs. I got frustrated that these guys had ruined my hunt and stood up, got situated and began to head west with my cart once again. As I crossed their path I noticed a distinct game trail that they had used. I continued on and hunted that evening and the rest of the week in the area. I had my phone/camera in my hand while I watched them walk closely by, I had no fear or reason to take a picture or a video because it never crossed my mind that I was seeing anything but foolish hunters. They were walking rapidly but quietly, they walked fully upright with human posture, normal armswing. Narrow at the waist and broad across the back. They appeared to be 3 physically fit tall young hunters in unusual black gille suits. They were big but not alarmingly big. All 3 were identical size and shape. Maybe 64 to 66, 250lbs. I did not notice an odor. Because they were quartering away I did not see or for that matter even look for any facial features.Three big dudes in black gillie suits with no hunter orange, no rifles, no gear walk directly in front of my loaded rifle, and me and my big ugly wagon are close, in the open, and in plain sight. I told my buddies at work about it, they suggested that it might be Fish and Game Commission trying to catch poachers. For two years something just didnt seem right about the whole incident. The more I thought about it the more uswered questions I had. Uswered Questions:	They walked about 10 yards from me, in very good light, me and my wagon were very conspicuous. I was motionless but how could a person much less 3 people not see me out in this open terrain?	They walked in front of another hunter with a loaded rifle. No hunter would do that.	They had no gear, no vests, no hunting weapons, they were carrying nothing. If they were not hunting, were they hunters?	Black gillie suits, I have a green one and a tan one, have never worn either while hunting because they snag on everything. Why would someone wear a black gillie suit in a green environment? 	If 3 hunters decided to hunt in gillie suits they would probably be green and would likely be different from one another, these were all exactly the same. 	Gillie suits are usually and on purpose very asymmetrical, often baggy and droopy with rows of material sewn on. These were form fitting and uniformly 3 or 4 inches in length, I would describe as looking like wet hair. 	The banging noise. About a year ago on a Saturday I was watching River Monsters, Swamp People and one of the Bigfoot shows. It dawned on me that the banging around might have been tree knocks. Until watching that show 2 years after the incident I had never heard about tree knocks, so I had not previously made the connection, and that it when I began to wonder whether I had actually seen something other than hunters that day. "

55236,"I think I may have seen a Sasquatch near the Montgomery Game Ranch in Jack county last night, slightly before midnight.  A few friends and I were dirt road driving through several very wild and remote parts of our county. We stopped to look and listen. I put my generation one night vision monocular on the edge of a clearing. I noticed a large, black, and roundish shape. I thought it might be a cow but when I focused on it, it stood up slowly on two legs, appeared to be very tall, and took three or four really long, liquid, and smooth steps to get behind a nearby mesquite tree. It appeared to be a huge, man like figure. It appeared to me to be moving slowly to avoid detection, i.e. moving slowly and smoothly with no sudden movements. I tried to zoom in but all I could make out was a huge black shape behind the tree. I was not able to record it and I was the only one in the group who saw it. It's size and the fluidity of its movements are what stuck in my mind the most. It was more coordinated and smoother than even a wild cat. After growing up on a cattle ranch in this part of the country and spending many years as a park ranger, I have seen many wild animals. This was like nothing I have ever seen before. I can't say for sure I saw a Sasquatch but feel strongly that I might have. "
56061,"On our way home to Rockmart, GA from Birmingham, AL, we were following the directions the GPS gave for the distance.  This brought us to Hwy 120 and Vincent Mountain Road.  We had just made that turn and gone a mile and a half when my husband and myself saw a large figure standing in the tree line.  There was illumination coming from the right side of the road from an additional light source other than our car headlights.  This enabled us to clearly see this figure that was on the left side of the road with one arm straight down and the other arm slightly moving.  I believe that arm movement is what caught our attention making us both look to our left CLEARLY allowing us both to view this creature.  It was covered in reddish brown fur from head to toe with a face I can only describe as Ape like. It appeared to be over seven feet tall. He/she seemed to be getting ready to cross the road. After about 15 seconds past, he and I both screamed out, ""did you just see what I saw???""  I have never been a big believer in the legend of Bigfoot, but I know what I saw tonight.  And I am floored.  I have never written to any site such as this about anything in my life and I certainly didn't think I would start at 56 years old.Thank you for your time. "

62340,"Location:2334 River Mountain Road Delaware, AR 7283535.309576, -93.375676I saw a white Bigfoot in Arkansas, circa 1976-1977. It was during the summer, probably July or August. It was around 8 in the morning. I was on vacation with my family to see relatives. I was walking across the road to go see my friend who lived across the road. This is in a very secluded area and these were the only two houses in the area. It was all dense trees, except for this one area that was cleared of trees and had a pond in the middle of it. I looked out to my left and saw this very tall white thing walking. It was walking along a barbwire fence from my left to right (East to West) from one tree line to the other. As my walking slowed trying to comprehend what it was, a fear came over me. Fortunately it hadn't spotted me yet. I looked to my left in front of me was a tree stump next to a barbwire fence. I instantly crouched down and moved as quick as I could without drawing attention to myself and to position myself behind the stump, and I continued to watch it walk out of sight. Fortunately it never did look in my direction. I never saw its face or hands but the hair seemed silvery white, similar in shades to aluminum foil.   I later figured out that the barbwire fence that ran around that whole area was 4' tall. It was easily double the height of the fence, so I would say in the 8'-10' tall range. It was slender and not bulky like Patty from the Patterson-Gimlin footage. I only ever told that friend about it, because I didn't know what it was and wondered if my eyes were playing a trick on me, because back then, no one ever heard of a white bigfoot, let alone realize that they come in all colors, similar to human hair.Technicals:[[Matt Moneymaker's note: To see the location in Google Earth simply copy and paste these coordinates into the Search box 35.309576, -93.375676then click the Search button.]][Witness:] Google Earth tells me the distance was 700', though it felt like it was about a football field. Also, on the maps there is a clearing to the left of the road, that was all trees back then. And the clearing on the other (right) side of the tree line was all trees too, you can see that they are tree farming a lot just outside of this area. Also none of those other houses were there.

65867,"On August 1st, 2020, my 3 sons and I were out for a day-trip drive along the Lake Huron shoreline, north of Lexington, MI. There's many stretches of wooded areas on the lake side of the road, and rural farmland on the west side, along this route. At approximately 12:50 PM, 1 and a half to 2 miles south of Port Sanilac, MI, we were driving northbound on M-25, and my oldest son (15 yrs), seated next to me in the front, said ""Oh my God"" and stared straight ahead. I was still driving, and asked him what was wrong. He didn't initially answer and his 13 year old brother (seated behind him in the backseat) also asked him what was the matter. He finally spurted out ""I just saw a bigfoot!"".I thought he was joking at first, as he's always been a notable skeptic of my interest in Sasquatch research. But he adamantly insisted he wasn't kidding and described what he saw in the woods on the east side (Lakeside) of the road. He said he saw a large dark figure walking south through the woods. He says it was too a dark in the canopy of the woods to see a face, but the reason he noticed it at all was that it was moving exactly like the figure ""in that old grainy footage that everyone always talks about"" (the Patterson footage). He says the arms were longer than its torso and that he could tell it had fur much in the same way you can tell a dog has fur from a distance, that it wasn't skin that he was seeing. It was definitely walking, not standing still, and it's arms were swinging. He guesses that it was around 100 yards or less away. He estimates that it was around 8 feet tall (he said his impression of it made him feel short. My son is 6' 2""). He says it had very broad shoulders. He was able to watch it for approximately 5 seconds as we traveled in the opposite direction that it was headed. As soon as he told me what he'd seen, I turned around and drove back to the location. Traffic was moderately steady, being a summer Saturday afternoon, so it took a couple minutes to return to the exact spot and then find a safe spot nearby to pull off. We didn't see anything at that point, but I pinned the area on my GPS. The exact coordinates are 43.391164, -82.539186 "
65894,"I just got back from a region known as Madawaska Valley in Renfrew County about 3 hours north of me (Whitby). It is located on the southern edge of Algonquin Park. Several reports have come out of that park in including an encounter I had back in 2008. It was a ""Class B"" experience while camping with 3 of my friends in that park. Rock throwing, odor and feces found.My family and I rented a cottage this week on a small private lake called Spectacle Lake. The cottage is surrounded by forest and the region has a good population of moose, deer, wolf, beaver and bear. On Monday, July 27th when we arrived at 15:00 hrs we got unpacked and got settled in for the afternoon. At 18:00 hrs we had a nice dinner and then sat around a bigbon fire at approximately 20:00 hrs. At about 22:00 hrs while sitting and talking around the fire I heard something across the lake in the distance. I told everyone to be quiet because I could hear something above the sound of our fire. I then heard these series of howls come from across the lake. The distance across the lake is about 500 meters. The area has thick forest with cliffs in the background. The howls seemed to come well beyond the distance across the lake and even beyond the cliffs behind the tree line. I would estimate the cliffs to be approximately 150 meters high. There are no cottages directly across the lake. There are 3 small cottages at a distance to the north of us, however, no one was at those cottages during the week. Having heard these kinds of sounds before I figured it was a Sasquatch, but no one else in my group has experienced this before. Naturally they were all taken back and quite excited by this. Everyone agreed the howls did not sound like wolves, coyotes, loons, deer, moose or any other kind of animal we are familiar with. These howls went on intermittently for about a 1/2 hr and each time it happened there were about 3 - 4 howls. About midnight the fire was dying down and we all headed into the cottage for the night, but just before going in we heard a large branch break close by. I would estimate about 20 feet from the cottage in the tree line and it was a clear distinct ""crack"" of a tree limb I would estimate of about 1"" or more (?)  Again, I knew what this was, having experienced this many times, and so I tried to peer into the tree line to see if I can see anything. I heard nothing else and saw nothing. I didn't want to shine flashlight because I knew this might end the activity for the night, so I went inside the cottage. We all went to bed shortly afterwards.At 03:31 hrs (I looked the time immediately) something hit or threw something at the cottage very hard. It shook the cottage and woke all of us up. Keep in mind this is a fairly large cottage that is two storeys tall with a basement walkout and sleeps all 8 of us well. I knew what was happening and got up to look around. I wanted to rule out any of the kids or dogs possibly walking around and maybe knocked something off of a shelf in the dark, so I walked all around the house from top to bottom. Everyone, including the dogs were in their beds. The dogs never moved from their spots, even though I know they heard/felt the bang. I looked outside and saw nothing in the pitch darkness so I went back to bed. I lay there awake and listened for any other activity. Then about a 1/2 hr later I could hear something ""mumbling/grumbling"" outside the open window. That's the best way I can describe it. It was close to my window, but I still couldn't see anything when I looked out. I still did not want to shine a light, hoping for more activity. At 04:15 hrs something gave a long, hard ""scrape"" along the outside of the cottage. Then nothing.In the morning at 06:30 hrs I woke up and checked the outside perimeter of the cottage and the surrounding area. The ground is hard all around the cottage, so I found no imprints. I went inside the tree line, but still could find no definite prints. I could see no ""hand prints"" or signs of damage on the outside walls of the cottage. I could not find the tree break. I could not see any rocks or sticks lying close to the cottage that could have been thrown at the cottage. I found no physical signs of the ""scrape"" either.The next night, Tuesday, July 28th, while sitting by our bonfire again we heard the same screams/howl from across the lake. This would occur off and on until about 5 am. The recording I took from my bedroom in the middle of the night at 02:31 am. Either put your computer on speakers or listen close to your phone when listening to it. There are 4 howls heard and the last one is the loudest/clearest.There was no more activity of any kind on Wednesday or Thursday, but I heard these screams/howls again on Friday, July 31st during the night.Coordinates:  Latitude - 45.5340, Longitude - 77.858040, GPS co-ordinates - 45 degrees 31'20.424""N, 77 degrees 51' 28.944W Temperature:   21 degrees Celcius Monday, Tuesday evening/night , 25 degrees Celcius Friday evening/night Latitude 45.5340, Longitude - 77.858040, GPS co-ordinates - 45 degrees 31'20.424""N, 77 degrees 51' 28.944WSpectacle Lake Rd. off of Hwy 60"

We were camping in the bed of our pick-up truck underneath a tarp.  During the night I awoke to the sounds of a large animal walking past the truck.  My first thoughts were that it was a moose because the impacts of its feet/hooves were those of a heavy animal.  I started to raise up to look and my fiance grabbed my arm and asked me to stop because she thought the animal would hear me.  The interesting part of this is that she is hearing impaired.  She was not hearing the animal walk by, what she told me later is that she heard the animal make a noise that she could not attribute to any animal she had ever heard.  She said she felt the sound more than heard it.  I should note that I never heard this sound being emitted by the animal, all I heard was the impacts of its feet.  After the animal walked away I laid down figuring I missed a good chance to see a moose.  Approximately 5 minutes later I heard three very distinctive wood knocks.

75162,"On September 8, 2022 my son and I packed up to go kayak-camping the Lower Buffalo River. We planned a three night trip as we would take our time as we were fishing.  We drove for about 6 or 7 hours and finally arrived. We put in at Rush and only went about four miles that afternoon and just soaked up the beauty. We made camp and enjoyed a peaceful night. On September 9, 2022 we started the day at first light. We knew that we wanted to camp close to Big Creek to keep on schedule, so we fished all day and simply enjoyed the day. By late afternoon it was hot but not too hot. I believe the temp was somewhere around 83-85 degrees and a somewhat clear day with low humidity. At approximately 4:00 pm, I believe we had stopped fishing and were looking for a good campsite as we were getting close to Big Creek. I believe that there was some type of obstruction or a cut to the left where we werent paddling but simply letting the river push us. We were quiet and not talking, just quietly floating.  At [36.0931117, -92.4756105] which was to our left, at approximately 20 yards away we heard what can best be described as a pissed off monkey. Literally sounded like a monkey as it ripped away at whatever was in its path as it went away from the river. It was still making the pissed off monkey sounds as it tore through the woods. We both looked surprised and asked what the hell was that as we started paddling away from the location. We joked about the sound and just wanted to put a little distance between us and the pissed off monkey. This occurred just north of Big Creek approximately 1.29 miles. We paddled about 2.78 river miles from the pissed off monkey and stopped on the river left at a small gravel bar to make camp, at 36.0930645, -92.4567744The gravel bar wasnt that wid, and was approximately 15-20 yards long but was in good shade. Our goal this afternoon was to find a good shaded area where we wouldnt cook as the sun went behind the ridge. Since there was no rain forecast we figured we were good.  Also, the water had been dropping all day. We went into full camp mode and started to get everything set up. Thats when we heard the first wood knock. We both stopped what we were doing and looked towards the knock. From our camp it was from the ridge line across the river from us and north up the ridge, a little down river. I looked at my son and said that was a dang wood knock. Now, we joked earlier that the pissed off monkey sound could have been an ole squatch but we were joking. I actually believed my son said that a bear can make some crazy sounds like that when surprised. Regardless, we have now just heard a tree knock, no doubt about that. We both made some sly comments jokingly about it and continued to set up camp.Our camp was on a narrow gravel and rock bar that was approximately 15-20 yards wide. We had a clear field of view up and down the river. Our two tents were set up about 20 feet from the tree line with the tents only being about 12 feet apart. The fire was directly in front of both tents and split the difference from the tents and the water. We had two kayaks pulled completely out of the water to our front right. Once camp was set we jumped in the river for a little while and knocked the days grime off. After that we walked the rock bar and  fished for a very short time and then gathered enough wood to have a fire that would last us until we hit the sack. We then settled in by a fire and just talked about the day.At approximately 8:00 pm the night started creeping in and I grabbed my weather radio to check the weather since rain was supposed to move in the next day. We sat around and listened to two regional reports and clicked it off. It was immediately after that that all hell would break loose and would last until 4:00 am. As if from on que, we heard a yell aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh that came from the ridge line close to where the tree knock was earlier. That freaked us out! We immediately jumped up at the same time and walked towards the water where the campfire smoke wouldnt block our view. We started looking in the general area and began talking about what the hell would or even could make that noise. We then started asking ourselves if someone could be up on the ridge messing with us. Doubtful based on the location and terrain. We were, after all, in the wilderness. The yell was extremely loud and deep and sounded pissed. It wasnt no time after that, in fact my son was still standing up, that we heard a noise coming from our rear but it was higher pitched and I couldnt make it out but it had a melody to it. I stood up and looked at my son and asked what the hell was that? He said, you dont want to know what I heard. And of course I said I do. He said it sounded like a woman singing. Now that really freaked me out but freaked my son out more because he could actually hear it better. We immediately both went to our tents and retrieved our handguns without a word being spoken. My concern was that now something was on our side of the river and I didnt like that idea at all. I immediately began lighting up our camp. I wasnt sure what was going on but I didnt have a good feeling about any of it. I had 3 pop up led lanterns, a battery operated canopy string led light, and chemlights. I strung the string light up behind the tents at the woodline, placed one popup lantern between the tents, one to our right and one to our left. The fire was to our front and I tied a Chemlight to a fishing pole on each kayak. Once we had a lighted perimeter set we began gathering all the wood we could possibly gather and settled in listening more than talking. Between 9:00 - 9:30 pm the first rock of the evening came flying off the ridge and landed in the river to our left -- close to where the first tree knock came from but further towards the front of our position. Im not talking about a small rock, I mean cantaloupe size. We both jumped up and walked to the edge of the water with flashlights and pistols. We scanned the ridge but didnt see anything. It was then that I told my son that this thing is pissed and wants us out of here. We sat back down and discussed our options. We cant run the Buffalo River at night on a section that weve never seen before. We literally dont know whats around the next bend. We have no choice but to hunker down and prepare the best we can. We went and gathered more wood. Once we gathered all that we could we sat down and discussed what we would do. I told my son that he would sleep first but to drag his cot out of his tent and place it between the fire and one of the perimeter lights. He would sleep for 2 hours while I pulled fire watch and then we would swap. At 10:30 pm my son settled in to sleep as I started my first watch. At approximately 10:45 pm I heard a tree knock that was close to the same location as the first tree knock. However, immediately after the knock, and for the first time since the initial contact, I heard the pissed off monkey sounds. It seemed more ramped up than the first. The pissed off monkey was further down the ridge and to the north but close to the end of the ridge and the river. I then got worried because this thing wasnt far from the other gravel bar that we could see from camp. It could easily cross the river and come in on a flanking move or come to our rear. At approximately 10:50 pm, immediately across from us and on top of the ridge, I heard a very very deep chatter/mumble vocalization. I immediately recognized the sounds from the Sierra Sounds. Same Samurai sound but seemed deeper. It was at that time that I realized that we were in trouble. With the pissed off monkey making his way down the ridge and the Samurai sounds, my stomach turned. I started doing notes on my phone because I was actually afraid that something was going to happen if we didnt leave. I figured that we were possibly at our last stand location and the night was not going to end well. I had to make the decision to start doing notes to make sure that someone would read what happened in the event everything went bad. I also did a video of the campsite and how everything was set up, along with my son sleeping. In my gut I felt that we didnt have a chance in hell. We were trapped with our backs to the river and the ridge. We had no way to get the hell out of there and no way to call for help due to no cellphone service. Continuing with my watch, at approximately 11:45 pm I heard chattering in the same location as the first tree knocks and at 12:30 am my watch ended. I woke my son and gave him all this information. I also advised him to watch our rear because the pissed off monkey may be trying to work his way to our rear. I racked out.My son woke me up for my second watch and passed on his information. He said he heard the pissed off monkey and a rock thrown into the river. Then later he heard a tree knock. He advised that all this took place directly across the river from camp. At 2:45 am, the last watch began. I had to go out and try to find firewood because we werent going to have enough to last through the night. I was able to scavenge some within the wood line but had to make multiple trips due to having only one hand free, the pistol was in the other. At approximately 3:17 am I heard a deep pissed off monkey sound immediately across from camp on the ridge that was immediately followed up with yet another rock thrown into the river. At approximately 3:26 am I heard deep chattering halfway down the ridge that actually scared the hell out of me because it was coming down closer. At approximately 3:32 am I heard a tree snap to my rear. It was the sound of good firewood that you put on your knee and you snap it in half except this sounded like a log that got snapped. I jumped up, pointed my pistol in the general direction and woke my son, he slept through it. I explained to him what just happened and he armed himself. While facing the treeline we slowly backed up to the fire as we scanned the area. I didnt hear anything run off and best I could tell it was about 20 yards behind the tree line and up the ridge. While backed up to the fire and on guard, I started running through the events that happened while I was on watch. We both came to the realization that things were escalating and we had to do something. After a brief discussion we decided that we had to do something to show we had intention to leave. We decided that we would start breaking down camp and pack everything into the kayaks. We did just that. It did not take us long at all and before no time the kayaks were loaded and all that was left were our chairs, water bottles and the lighted perimeter. At approximately 4:00 AM we had the fire blazing and sat down. Not long after we sat down my son said did you hear that and I said no but then I heard something that sounded like a laugh. I looked at my son and said what the hell. He said he heard one whistle and pointed to our right and across the river. Then he pointed to our left and said another one was laughing at us from across the river. The whistle I did not hear. We sat there in our chairs until sunrise with no further activities. Right before first light we began gathering up everything and finalized our packing. As soon as we walked to our kayaks to push them off, a rock came off the ridge, hit a tree on the way down and hit the water in front of us. I shouted we were leaving and we did just that. We paddled about 12 miles straight to the White River where we came out at Rileys Outfitters. Neither one of us said a word about this to anyone we encountered at the Outfitters. Needless to say, our trip was cut short but we were good with that.After we returned home I battled with the thought of contacting the Ranger Station at Buffalo Point. I knew that this story was going to sound crazy but I would have felt guilty if I read something later on about a family being hurt on that section of the river and I never said anything. So, on September 11, 2022 I started using my law enforcement contacts in an effort to speak directly with a Ranger on the Buffalo. All the information was passed along through a contact and I was advised that I would receive a phone call. That call came a few days later and all the information was passed along.  I was advised that an investigation would take place at the coordinates that I released and that I would be contacted if any further information was needed. "
